### WORKED EXAMPLE 17 (例题)

**题目**: WORKED EXAMPLE 17
Estimate the value of:
4.6+3.9 a 398
b 42.2-5.1

**解答**: Answers
4.6+3.9 is approximately equal to 5+4 398 400
$$
= \frac {9}{2 0} = \frac {4 . 5}{1 0} = 0. 4 5
$$
Check the estimate:
$$
\frac {4 . 6 + 3 . 9}{3 9 8} = 0. 4 2 6 (3 \mathrm {s . f .})
$$
Round the numbers to 1 significant figure.
If you use a calculator you will find the exact value and see that the estimate was good.
b  $\sqrt{42.2 - 5.1}$  is approximately equal to  $\sqrt{40 - 5}$
$$
= \sqrt {3 5}
$$
$$
i s \text {a p p r o x i m a t e l y e q u a l t o} \sqrt {3 6}
$$
$$
= 6
$$
Begin by rounding each value to 1 significant figure.
Notice that if you round 35 up to 36 you get a square number and you can easily take the square root.

## 2 Making sense of algebra > 2.1 Using letters to represent unknown values

### WORKED EXAMPLE 1 (例题)

**题目**: WORKED EXAMPLE 1
Use algebra to write an expression in terms of  $h$  (which represents average height) for:
a a height 12 cm shorter than average
b a height 2a taller than average
a height twice the average height
d a height half the average height.

**解答**: Answers
a  $h - 12$  Shorter than means less than, so you subtract.
b  $h + 2a$  Taller than means more than, so you add. 2a is unknown, but it can still be used in the expression.
$2\times h = 2h$  Twice means two times, so you multiply by two.
d  $h\div 2 = \frac{h}{2}$  Half means divided by two.

---

### WORKED EXAMPLE 2 (例题)

**题目**: WORKED EXAMPLE 2
Write expressions in terms of  $x$  to represent:
a the number times four
b the sum of the number and five
c six times the number minus two
d half the number.

**解答**: Answers
a x times four Let  $x$  represent 'the number'.
$$
= x \times 4 \quad \text {R e p l a c e ' t i m e s f o u r ' w i t h} \times 4.
$$
Leave out the  $\times$  sign, write the number before the variable.
TIP
Mathematicians write the product of a number and a variable with the number first to avoid confusion with powers. For example, you would write  $x \times 5$  is as  $5x$  and not as  $x5$ , which is easy to confuse with  $x^5$ .
WORKED EXAMPLE 2 CONTINUED
b Sum of x and five
$$
= x + 5
$$
Let  $x$  represent 'the number'.
Sum of means  $^+$  , replace five with 5.
Six times x minus two
$$
= 6 \times x - 2
$$
Let  $x$  represent 'the number'.
Times means  $\times$  and minus means -, insert numerals.
$$
= 6 x - 2
$$
Leave out the  $\times$  sign.
d Half x
$$
= x \div 2
$$
Let  $x$  represent 'the number'.
$$
= \frac {x}{2}
$$
Half means  $\times \frac{1}{2}$  or  $\div 2$
Write the division as a fraction.

### WORKED EXAMPLE 3 (例题)

**题目**: WORKED EXAMPLE 3
Find the size of the angle marked  $x$  in each of these figures. Give reasons.
![image](images/2175285ab5e295fa85d0319226323163fa4c4bf6562d1c9eff9675b9ec0d1bbb.jpg)
a  $72^{\circ} + x = 90^{\circ}$  angle ABC  $= 90^{\circ}$  comp angles)
$$
\begin{array}{l} x = 9 0 ^ {\circ} - 7 2 ^ {\circ} \\ x = 1 8 ^ {\circ} \\ \end{array}
$$
You are told that angle ABC is a right angle, so you know that  $72^{\circ}$  and  $x$  are complementary angles. This means that  $72^{\circ} + x = 90^{\circ}$ , so you can solve to find the value of  $x$ .

**解答**: ![image](images/8021efb0fb66e606e53c25ab82c2a01ff911d174b1461b8a2a95b1a71db7e27f.jpg)
b  $48^{\circ} + 90^{\circ} + x = 180^{\circ}$  (angles on line)
$$
\begin{array}{l} x = 1 8 0 ^ {\circ} - 9 0 ^ {\circ} - 4 8 ^ {\circ} \\ x = 4 2 ^ {\circ} \\ \end{array}
$$
You can see that  $48^{\circ}$  the right angle and  $x$  are angles on a straight line. Angles on a straight line add up to  $180^{\circ}$ . So you can rearrange to make  $x$  the subject.
![image](images/253c1fd50fe41c61cc4715cd052fbab25445cffd2fdee9c6b76287b1fe4a0d25.jpg)
c  $x = 30^{\circ}$  (vertically opposite angles)
You know that when two lines intersect, the resulting vertically opposite angles are equal.  $x$  and  $30^{\circ}$  are vertically opposite, so  $x = 30^{\circ}$

### WORKED EXAMPLE 4 (例题)

**题目**: WORKED EXAMPLE 4
Find the size of angles  $a, b$  and  $c$  in this figure.
![image](images/75d21a47195eee357281a134b6cf6317cfd1341c9b2abfe4e89f3e8f8d3667b3.jpg)

**解答**: Answer
$a = 47^{\circ}$  (CAB alt SBA)
$c = 62^{\circ}$  (ACB alt CBT)
$a + b + c = 180^{\circ}$  (angles on line)
$\therefore b = 180^{\circ} - 47^{\circ} - 62^{\circ}$
$b = 71^{\circ}$
CAB and SBA are alternate angles and are equal. ACB and CBT are alternate angles and equal.
Angles on a straight line  $= 180^{\circ}$
You know the values of  $a$  and  $c$ , so can use these to find  $b$ .

**题目**: Aisha wanted to find out what people thought about pop-up adverts on their social media feeds. She did a survey of 100 people. Each person chose an answer A, B, C or D.
What do you think about this statement? Please choose one response.
Advertising should be strictly controlled on social media. Pop-up adverts should be banned from all social media feeds.
A I strongly agree
B I agree
C I disagree
D I strongly disagree
Aisha recorded these results:
[Table Row] <tr><td>A</td><td>B</td><td>A</td><td>C</td><td>A</td><td>C</td><td>C</td><td>D</td><td>A</td><td>C</td></tr>
[Table Row] <tr><td>C</td><td>C</td><td>D</td><td>A</td><td>D</td><td>D</td><td>C</td><td>C</td><td>C</td><td>A</td></tr>

a Draw a tally table to organise the results.
b What do the results of her survey suggest people think about pop-up advertising on social media?

**解答**: Answers
a
[Table Row] <tr><td>Response</td><td>Tally</td></tr>
[Table Row] <tr><td>A</td><td>HHHHHHIII</td></tr>
[Table Row] <tr><td>B</td><td>HHHHHHIII</td></tr>
[Table Row] <tr><td>C</td><td>HHHHHHHHHHII</td></tr>
[Table Row] <tr><td>D</td><td>HHHHHH</td></tr>
Count each letter. Make a tally each time you count one.
It may help to cross the letters off the list as you count them.
Check that your tallies add up to 100 to make sure you have included all the scores. (It is more efficient to work across the rows or down the columns, putting a tally into the correct row in your table, rather than counting one letter at a time.)
b The results suggest that people generally don't think advertising should be banned on social media. 57 people disagreed or strongly disagreed. Only 24 of the 100 people strongly agreed with Aisha's statement.
By giving people a very definite statement and asking them to respond to it, Aisha has shown her own bias and that could affect the results of her survey. It is quite possible that people think some control is necessary, but not that adverts should be banned completely. However, they don't have that as an option when they answer. The people in the sample could also affect the responses, so Aisha will have to carefully consider any conclusions from this survey.

Group the ages in intervals of ten, 10-19; 20-29 and so on.
These are two-digit numbers, so the tens digit is the stem.
List the stems in ascending order down the left of the diagram.
Work through the data in the order it is given, writing the units digits (the leaves) in a row next to the appropriate stem. Space the leaves to make them easier to read.
If you need to work with the data, you can redraw the diagram, putting the leaves in ascending order.
From this reorganised stem-and-leaf diagram you can quickly see that:
the youngest person using the internet cafe was 17 years old (the first data item)
the oldest person was 55 (the last data item)
- most users were in the age group 30-39 (the group with the largest number of leaves).

[Table Row] <tr><td>Number of hours</td><td>7</td><td>8</td><td>1.5</td><td>3</td><td>2.5</td><td>2</td></tr>
Draw a pie chart to show this data.
$7 + 8 + 1.5 + 3 + 2.5 + 2 = 24$  First work out the total number of hours.
Then work out each category as a fraction of the whole and convert the fraction to degrees:
[Table Row] <tr><td></td><td>(as a fraction of 24)</td><td>(convert to degrees)</td></tr>
[Table Row] <tr><td>School</td><td>= 7/24</td><td>= 7/24 × 360 = 105°</td></tr>
[Table Row] <tr><td>Sleeping</td><td>= 8/24</td><td>8/24 × 360 = 120°</td></tr>
[Table Row] <tr><td>Eating</td><td>= 1.5/24 = 15/240</td><td>15/240 × 360 = 22.5°</td></tr>
[Table Row] <tr><td>Online</td><td>= 3/24</td><td>3/24 × 360 = 45°</td></tr>
[Table Row] <tr><td>On the phone</td><td>= 2.5/24 = 25/240</td><td>25/240 × 360 = 37.5°</td></tr>

### WORKED EXAMPLE 2 (例题)

**题目**: WORKED EXAMPLE 2
Which two of  $\frac{5}{6}, \frac{20}{25}$  and  $\frac{15}{18}$  are equivalent fractions?

**解答**: Answer
5 is already in its simplest form.
Alternative method
Simplify each of the other fractions:
You could have written:
$$
\frac {2 0}{2 5} = \frac {2 0 + 5}{2 5 + 5} = \frac {4}{5}
$$
$$
\frac {5 1 8}{1 8} = \frac {5}{6}
$$
$$
\frac {1 5}{1 8} = \frac {1 5 \div 3}{1 8 \div 3} = \frac {5}{6}
$$
This is called cancelling and is a shorter way of showing what you have done.
So  $\frac{5}{6}$  and  $\frac{15}{18}$  are equivalent.

### WORKED EXAMPLE 15 (例题)

**题目**: WORKED EXAMPLE 15
In a sale all items are reduced by  $15\%$ . If the normal price for a bicycle is $120, calculate the sale price.

**解答**: Answer
$$
100\% -15\% = 85\%
$$
Reducing a number by  $15\%$  leaves you with  $85\%$  of the original. So, find  $85\%$  of the original value.
$$
\frac {8 5}{1 0 0} \times \$ 1 2 0 = \$ 1 0 2
$$
85% is equivalent to  $\frac{85}{100} = 0.85$
Or use a multiplier:
$$
0. 8 5 \times \$ 1 2 0 = 1 0 2
$$

### WORKED EXAMPLE 17 (例题)

**题目**: WORKED EXAMPLE 17
A store is holding a sale in which every item is reduced by  $10\%$ . A jacket in this sale is sold for $108.
Calculate the original price of the jacket.

**解答**: Answer
\(\frac{90}{100} \times x = 108\) The new cost is \(90\%\) of the original.  
\(x = \frac{100}{90} \times 108\) To solve for \(x\), multiply both sides of the equation by Original price \(= \\)120\) the reciprocal of \(\frac{90}{100}\).
It is important to remember that undoing a  $10\%$  decrease is not the same as increasing the reduced value by  $10\%$ . If you increase the sale price of  $108$  by  $10\%$  you will get  $\frac{110}{100} \times \$108 = \$118.80$ , which is a different (and incorrect) answer.

### WORKED EXAMPLE 18 (例题)

**题目**: WORKED EXAMPLE 18
A shop advertises a laptop for sale for \(320 during a \(20 \%\)off sale. What was the original price of the laptop?

![图片](../images/6fbcec285db2eebb31934ad20a80be77984935ac09cfb7fa3c974ac92fe79323.jpg)

![image](images/6fbcec285db2eebb31934ad20a80be77984935ac09cfb7fa3c974ac92fe79323.jpg)
Draw a bar model.
20% has been taken off, so $320 is 80% of the original cost.
$$
1 \% = \frac {\mathbb {S} 320}{80} = \mathbb {S} 4
$$
$$
100 \% = \$ 4 \times 100 = \$ 400
$$
Divide $320 by 80 to find 1%
Multiply $4 by 100 to find 100%

**解答**: Answer
3.2
![image](images/0778d4feeafc62ec947d4ef04174d0e6077b287f1957717e7f5cbf1203d4305a.jpg)
Write the number with the decimal point after the first non-zero digit to get a number between 1 and 10.
Work out how many places the first digit needs to move to get back to its original place. In this case, the 3 needs to move five places to the left to get back to its original hundred thousands position.
$320000 = 3.2 \times 10^{5}$
Work out the index (power of 10). In this case, the original number is bigger than 3.2 so the index will be positive.
In other words, to move the digit 3 back to its original position you would need to multiply by 105.

**解答**: Answers
a
![image](images/0f8f19dec566363cffaac25ee7d6450dea87f14cd518d3ef8b1dba7090b616a6.jpg)
0.004
4.0
$= 4\times 10^{-3}$
Start with a number between 1 and 10, in this case 4.
Compare the position of the first digit: '4' needs to move three places to the right to get from the new number to the original number. In Worked example 19 you saw that moving five places to the left meant multiplying by  $10^{5}$ , so moving three places to the right means multiply by  $10^{-3}$ .
Notice also that the first non-zero digit in 0.004 is in the 3rd place after the decimal point and that the power of 10 is -3.
b
0.00000034=3.4÷107
$= 3.4\times 10^{-7}$
![image](images/8b976921fee8031ba438ff911325b9e3d00b5e9de04ead6f13c05686a2701cd7.jpg)
0000000034=3.4×10-7
The first non-zero digit in 0.00000034 is in the 7th place after the decimal point so the power of 10 is -7.

Rearrange the calculation.
Use the laws of indices where appropriate.
Write the number in standard form.
You may be asked to convert your answer to an ordinary number.
To convert  $6 \times 1011$  into an ordinary number, the  $6'$  needs to move 11 places to the left:
$$
6. 0 \times 1 0 ^ {1 1}

$$
The answer  $16 \times 10^{10}$  is numerically correct but it is not in standard form because 16 is not between 1 and 10.
You can change it to standard form by thinking of 16 as  $1.6 \times 10$ .

An equation with  $x$  on both sides and all  $x$  terms with the same sign:
a Solve the equation  $5x - 2 = 3x + 6$
Answer
$$
5 x - 2 = 3 x + 6
$$
$$
5 x - 2 - 3 x = 3 x + 6 - 3 x
$$
$$
2 x - 2 = 6
$$
$$
2 x - 2 + 2 = 6 + 2
$$
$$
2 x = 8
$$
$$
\frac {2 x}{2} = \frac {8}{2}
$$
$$
x = 4
$$

**解答**: Subtract  $3x$  from both sides.
Add 2 to both sides.
Divide both sides by 2.
An equation with  $x$  on both sides and  $x$  terms with different signs:
b Solve the equation  $5x + 12 = 20 - 11x$
Answer
$$
5 x + 1 2 = 2 0 - 1 1 x
$$
$$
5 x + 1 2 + 1 1 x = 2 0 - 1 1 x + 1 1 x
$$
$$
1 6 x + 1 2 = 2 0
$$
$$
1 6 x + 1 2 - 1 2 = 2 0 - 1 2
$$
$$
1 6 x = 8
$$
$$
\frac {1 6 x}{1 6} = \frac {8}{1 6}
$$

---

### 1a (例题)

**题目**: a Solve the equation  $5x - 2 = 3x + 6$

**解答**: $$
5 x - 2 = 3 x + 6
$$
$$
5 x - 2 - 3 x = 3 x + 6 - 3 x
$$
$$
2 x - 2 = 6
$$
$$
2 x - 2 + 2 = 6 + 2
$$
$$
2 x = 8
$$
$$
\frac {2 x}{2} = \frac {8}{2}
$$
$$
x = 4
$$
Subtract  $3x$  from both sides.
Add 2 to both sides.
Divide both sides by 2.

---

### 1b (例题)

**题目**: b Solve the equation  $5x + 12 = 20 - 11x$

**解答**: $$
5 x + 1 2 = 2 0 - 1 1 x
$$
$$
5 x + 1 2 + 1 1 x = 2 0 - 1 1 x + 1 1 x
$$
$$
1 6 x + 1 2 = 2 0
$$
$$
1 6 x + 1 2 - 1 2 = 2 0 - 1 2
$$
$$
1 6 x = 8
$$
$$
\frac {1 6 x}{1 6} = \frac {8}{1 6}
$$
$$
x = \frac {1}{2}
$$
This time add  $11x$  to both sides, so you have a positive number of  $x$ 's
Subtract 12 from both sides.

### 1e (例题)

**题目**: e Solve the equation  $\frac{2}{3} + \frac{1}{3x} = \frac{4 - x}{6x}$

**解答**: $$
6 x \left(\frac {2}{3} + \frac {1}{3 x}\right) = 6 x \left(\frac {4 - x}{6 x}\right)
$$
$$
4 x + 2 = 4 - x
$$
$$
4 x + x = 4 - 2
$$
$$
5 x = 2
$$
$$
x = \frac {2}{5}
$$
The lowest common denominator is  $6x$ , so multiply both sides by  $6x$ .
Collect  $x$  terms on one side and numbers on the other.
Divide both sides by 5.
Leave your answer as a fraction.

### WORKED EXAMPLE 3 (例题)

**题目**: WORKED EXAMPLE 3
Factorise each of the following expressions as fully as possible.
a  $15x + 12y$
b 18mn-30m
c  $36p^{2}q - 24pq^{2}$
d  $15(x - 2) - 20(x - 2)^{3}$
e  $6bx - 15cx + 10cy - 4by$
f ax + by + atx + bty

**解答**: a  $15x + 12y$
The HCF of 12 and 15 is 3, but  $x$  and  $y$  have no common factors.
${15x} + {12y} = 3\left( {{5x} + {4y}}\right)$
Because  $3 \times 5x = 15x$  and  $3 \times 4y = 12y$
b 18mn-30m
The HCF of 18 and  $30 = 6$  and the HCF of  $mn$  and  $m$  is  $m$ .
$$
1 8 m n - 3 0 m = 6 m (3 n - 5)
$$
Because  $6m \times 3n = 18mn$  and  $6m \times -5 = -30m$ .
36p²q-24pq²
The HCF of 36 and  $24 = 12$  and  $p^2 q$  and  $pq^2$  have common factor  $pq$ .
$$
3 6 p ^ {2} q - 2 4 p q ^ {2} = 1 2 p q (3 p - 2 q)
$$
Because  $12pq \times 3p = 36p^2q$  and  $12pq \times -2q = -24pq^2$ .
Sometimes, the terms can have an expression in brackets that is common to both terms.
d  $15(x - 2) - 20(x - 2)^{3}$
The HCF of 15 and 20 is 5 and the HCF of  $(x - 2)$  and  $(x - 2)^{3}$  is  $(x - 2)$
Because  $5(x - 2) \times 3 = 15(x - 2)$  and  $5(x - 2) \times 4(x - 2)^2 = 20(x - 2)^3$ .
$$
\begin{array}{l} 1 5 (x - 2) - 2 0 (x - 2) ^ {3} \\ 1 5 (x - 2) - 2 0 (x - 2) ^ {3} \\ = 5 (x - 2) [ 3 - 4 (x - 2) ^ {2} ] \\ \end{array}
$$

### WORKED EXAMPLE 3 CONTINUED (例题)

**题目**: WORKED EXAMPLE 3 CONTINUED
You also need to be able to factorise expressions in the form
$$
a x + b x + k a y + k b y.
$$
You can do this by collecting like terms and factorising the  $x$  and the  $y$  terms separately.
e 6bx-15cx+10cy-4by
f ax + by + atx + bty

**解答**: $$
\begin{array}{l} = (6 b x - 1 5 c x) + (1 0 c y - 4 b y) \quad \text {C o l l e c t} \\ = 3 x (2 b - 5 c) + 2 y (5 c - 2 b) \quad \text {F a c t o r i s e} x \text {a n d} y \text {t e r m s s e p a r a t e l y .} \\ = 3 x (2 b - 5 c) - 2 y (2 b - 5 c) \quad \text {T a k e a c o m m o n f a c t o r o f - 1 . T h e b r a c k e t} \\ = (2 b - 5 c) (3 x - 2 y) \quad (2 b - 5 c) \text {i s h o w a c o m m e n t i f a t i o n} \\ \end{array}
$$
$= ax + atx + by + bty$  Collect like terms and factorise the  $x$  and  $y$  terms separately.
$= ax(1 + t) + by(1 + t)$  The HCF of ax and atx is ax and the HCF of by and bty is by.
$= (ax + by)(1 + t)$  The bracket  $(1 + t)$  is a common factor.

## 6 Equations, factors and formulae > 6.3 Rearranging formulae

### 6.3 (例题)

**题目**: 6.3 Rearranging formulae
Formulae are very often expressed with one variable written alone on one side of the  $=$ ' symbol (usually on the left but not always). The variable that is written alone is called the subject of the formula. For example:
$$
\begin{array}{l} s = u t + \frac {1}{2} a t ^ {2} \quad (s \text {i s t h e s u b j e c t}) \\ F = m a \quad (F \text {i s t h e s u b j e c t}) \\ x = \frac {- b \pm \sqrt {b ^ {2} - 4 a c}}{2 a} \quad (x \text {i s t h e s u b j e c t}) \\ \end{array}
$$
Sometimes it is more helpful to have a different variable as the subject so you need to know how to change the subject of a formula. In the formula  $\nu = u + at$  the subject is currently  $\nu$ , but you can change the subject by rearranging the formula.
For example, to make  $a$  the subject of this formula:
$\nu = u + at$  Write down the starting formula.
$v - u = at$  Subtract  $u$  from both sides (to isolate the term containing  $a$
$\frac{v - u}{t} = a$  Divide both sides by  $t$  (notice that everything on the left is divided by  $t$ ).
You now have  $a$  on its own and so now  $a$  is the subject of the formula.
Usually we rewrite this so the subject is on the left:
$$
a = \frac {v - u}{t}
$$
Notice how similar this process is to solving equations.
Make the variable shown in brackets the subject of the formula in each case.

### WORKED EXAMPLE 4 (例题)

**题目**: WORKED EXAMPLE 4
For each calculation, give your answer as a multiple of  $\pi$ .
a Find the circumference of a circle with a diameter of  $12\mathrm{cm}$
b What is the exact circumference of a circle of radius  $4\mathrm{mm}$
c Determine the area of a circle with a diameter of  $10\mathrm{m}$
d What is the radius of a circle of circumference  $2.8\pi \mathrm{cm}$ ?

**解答**: Answers
a  $C = 12\pi \mathrm{cm}$
$$
C = \pi d
$$
Multiply the diameter by 12 and remember to write the units.
b C=2πr
$$
C = 2 \times \pi \times 4 = 8 \pi \mathrm {m m}
$$
Use this version of the formula since you have been told the radius.
A=πr²
$$
\begin{array}{l} r = 5 m, \text {s o} A = \pi \times 5 ^ {2} \\ A = 2 5 \pi m \\ \end{array}
$$
d C=2πr
$$
\begin{array}{l} \mathrm {S o}, r = \frac {\mathrm {C}}{2 \pi} \\ r = \frac {2 . 8 \pi}{2 \pi} = 1. 4 \mathrm {c m} \\ \end{array}
$$

## 8 Introduction to probability > 8.3 Combining independent and mutually exclusive events

### WORKED EXAMPLE 8 (例题)

**题目**: Noa and Sunja are both taking a music examination independently.
The probability that Noa passes is  $\frac{3}{4}$  and the probability that Sunja passes is  $\frac{5}{6}$ .
What is the probability that:
a both pass?
b neither passes?
at least one passes?
either Noa or Sunja passes (but not both)?

**解答**: a  $P(\text{both pass}) = P(\text{Noa passes and Sunja passes})$
The outcomes are independent so use the formula:
$$
= \frac {3}{4} \times \frac {5}{6} = \frac {1 5}{2 4} = \frac {5}{8}
$$
$$
P (A \text {a n d} B) = P (A) \times P (B)
$$
b  $P$  (neither passes)  $= P$  (Noa fails and Sunja fails
$$
\begin{array}{l} P (\text {f a i l}) = P (\text {n o t p a s s}) \\ = \left(1 - \frac {3}{4}\right) \times \left(1 - \frac {5}{6}\right) \\ = 1 - P (\text {p a s s}) \\ = \frac {1}{4} \times \frac {1}{6} \\ = \frac {1}{2 4} \\ \end{array}
$$
c  $P$  (at least one passes)  $= 1 - P$  (neither passes)
$$
= 1 - \frac {1}{2 4} = \frac {2 3}{2 4}
$$
d P(either Sunja or Noa passes)
$= P(\text{Noa passes and Sunja fails})$
or Noa fails and Sunja passes)
$$
\begin{array}{l} = \frac {3}{4} \times \frac {1}{6} + \frac {1}{4} \times \frac {5}{6} \\ = \frac {3}{2 4} + \frac {5}{2 4} \\ = \frac {8}{2 4} \\ = \frac {1}{3} \\ \end{array}
$$
'Noa passes and Sunja fails' and, 'Noa fails and Sunja passes,' are mutually exclusive because they cannot both happen at the same time. So use the formula:
$P(A$  or  $B) = P(A) + P(B)$  , where
A = Noa passes and Sunja fails
and
$B =$  Noa fails and Sunja passes.

### WORKED EXAMPLE 2 (例题)

**题目**: WORKED EXAMPLE 2
Find an expression for the nth term of the sequence 2, 5, 10, 17, 26 ...

![图片](../images/81450af1377167d9ecd59acbf7c58b2ccf09692c114eba7f696589ffedc6852d.jpg)

**解答**: Answer
Work out the difference between terms in the sequence. This is known as the first difference.
![image](images/3cd5aeb32df8100ddc3a940b47eacbb815e78763b932946faad57e657bbcb255.jpg)
The first difference is not constant so work out the second difference:
![image](images/81450af1377167d9ecd59acbf7c58b2ccf09692c114eba7f696589ffedc6852d.jpg)
The second difference is constant. This means the sequence is quadratic and the rule will involve  $n^2$ .
TIP
You may recognise that the numbers in this sequence are all 1 greater than the sequence of square numbers and be able to answer the question by inspection.
WORKED EXAMPLE 2 CONTINUED
Make a table to show the position of each term and include a row for the values of  $n^2$ .
[Table Row] <tr><td>n</td><td>1</td><td>2</td><td>3</td><td>4</td><td>5</td></tr>
[Table Row] <tr><td>Term</td><td>2</td><td>5</td><td>10</td><td>17</td><td>26</td></tr>
[Table Row] <tr><td>n2</td><td>1</td><td>4</td><td>9</td><td>16</td><td>25</td></tr>
Each term is 1 greater than the value of  $n^2$ , so the  $n$ th term is  $n^2 + 1$ .

**解答**: WORKED EXAMPLE 4 CONTINUED
Answer
The terms in sequence A go up by 3 each time. It is a linear sequence with common difference 3 and  $n$ th term  $3n + 2$ .
The terms in sequence B are each 1 greater than the square number sequence. So the nth term is  $n^2 + 1$ .
In sequence C, each term is found by adding the equivalent terms of sequence A and B together:  $5 + 2 = 7$ ,  $8 + 5 = 13$ , and so on. You can find the nth term in a similar way.
The completed table is:
[Table Row] <tr><td>Sequence</td><td>1st term</td><td>2nd term</td><td>3rd term</td><td>4th term</td><td></td><td>nth term</td></tr>

WORKED EXAMPLE 5 CONTINUED
b  $4p$  is in the formula
Notice that the number of squares increases by 4 from shape to shape.
This means that there will be a term  $4p^{\prime}$  in the formula.
$$
\begin{array}{l} \text {I f} p = 1 \text {t h e n} 4 p = 4 \\ 4 + 3 = 7 \\ s o, s = 4 p + 3 \\ \end{array}
$$
Now, if  $p = 1$  then  $4p = 4$ . The first term is 7, so you need to add 3.
This means that  $s = 4p + 3$ .
$$
\text {I f} p = 5 \text {t h e n}
$$
$$
4 p + 3 = 2 0 + 3 = 2 3,
$$
the rule is correct.
Check: if  $p = 5$  then there should be 23
squares, which is correct.
c For pattern 100,  $p = 100$  and  $s = 4 \times 100 + 3 = 403$ .
Notice that  $p$  has been used for the pattern number rather than  $n$  here. You can use any letters that you like – it doesn't have to be  $n$  every time.

**题目**: The position to term rule for a sequence is given as  $u_n = 3n - 1$ .
What are the first three terms of the sequence?

**解答**: Answer
Substitute  $n = 1$ ,  $n = 2$  and  $n = 3$  into the rule.
$$
u _ {1} = 3 (1) - 1 = 2 \quad \text {F o r t h e f i r s t t e r m ,} n = 1
$$
$$
u _ {2} = 3 (2) - 1 = 5

$$
u _ {3} = 3 (3) - 1 = 8

The first three terms are 2, 5 and 8.

### 7 (例题)

**题目**: The number 149 is a term in the sequence defined as  $u_{n} = n^{2} + 5$ .
Which term in the sequence is 149?

**解答**: Answer
$149 = n^{2} + 5$  Find the value of  $n$  when  $u_{n} = 149$
$$
1 4 9 - 5 = n ^ {2}
$$
$144 = n^{2}$ $n^2 = 144$  has solutions  $n = 12$  and
12 = n  $n = -12$  but we cannot have a -12th term so  $n = 12$
149 is the 12th term in the sequence.

### WORKED EXAMPLE 16 (例题)

**题目**: WORKED EXAMPLE 16
Rationalise the denominator for each of the following expressions:
3 4+√2 a 2+√5 3-√7

**解答**: Answers
3 3(2-√5) a 2+√5 (2+√5)(2-√5) Multiply the numerator and denominator by 2-√5.
$= 2\sqrt{5} -6$  Multiply the numerator and denominator by-1 to tidy it up.
$$
\begin{array}{l} = \frac {6 - 2 \sqrt {5}}{2 ^ {2} - (\sqrt {5}) ^ {2}} \quad \text {U s e} (\sqrt {a} + \sqrt {b}) (\sqrt {a} - \sqrt {b}) = (\sqrt {a}) ^ {2} - (\sqrt {b}) ^ {2}. \\ = \frac {6 - 2 \sqrt {5}}{4 - 5} \quad \text {S i m p l i f y .} \\ = \frac {6 - 2 \sqrt {5}}{- 1} \\ \end{array}
$$
TIP
Rationalising the denominator can help you simplify expressions when you are asked to give an exact answer. If you are asked for an approximate value, you can use a calculator to work with the surds and you don't need to rationalise the denominator.

**解答**: Answers
a Notice that the graph passes through the points (2, 4) and (4, 10).
$$
G r a d i e n t = \frac {y - c h a n g e}{x - c h a n g e} = \frac {1 0 - 4}{4 - 2} = \frac {6}{2} = 3
$$
b Notice that the graph passes through the points (2, 1) and (4, 0).
$$
G r a d i e n t = \frac {y - c h a n g e}{x - c h a n g e} = \frac {0 - 1}{4 - 2} = - \frac {1}{2}

### WORKED EXAMPLE 5 (例题)

**题目**: WORKED EXAMPLE 5
Find the gradient and  $y$ -intercept of the lines given by each of the following equations.
a  $y = 3x + 4$
b  $y = 5 - 3x$
$y = \frac{1}{2} x + 9$
d  $x + y = 8$
e  $3x + 2y = 6$

**解答**: Answers
a  $y = 3x + 4$
Gradient = 3
The coefficient of  $x$  is 3.
y-intercept = 4
The constant term is 4.
b  $y = 5 - 3x$
Re-write the equation as  $y = -3x + 5$ .
Gradient = -3
The coefficient of  $x$  is -3.
y-intercept = 5
The constant term is 5.
c  $y = \frac{1}{2} x + 9$
Gradient  $= \frac{1}{2}$
y-intercept = 9
The gradient can be a fraction.
d  $x + y = 8$
Subtract  $x$  from both sides to make  $y$  the subject:  $y = -x + 8$
Gradient  $= -1$
y-intercept = 8
e  $3x + 2y = 6$
Gradient  $= -\frac{3}{2}$
y-intercept = 3
Make y the subject of the equation:
$3x + 2y = 6$
$2y = -3x + 6$
$$
y = - \frac {3}{2} x + \frac {6}{2}
$$
$$
y = - \frac {3}{2} x + 3
$$

**解答**: Answers
a Gradient  $= 6$  and the  $y$  -intercept  $= -1$
So the equation is  $y = 6x - 1$
b Gradient  $= -\frac{3}{4}$  and the  $y$ -intercept  $= 1$
So the equation is  $y = -\frac{3}{4} x + 1$
Gradient  $= \frac{6}{1} = 6$
Graph crosses y-axis at -1.
Gradient  $= -\frac{1.5}{2} = -\frac{3}{4}$
Graph crosses y-axis at 1.

Given that  $y = \frac{2}{3} x + 2$ , determine the equation of the straight line that is:
a perpendicular to this line and which passes through the origin.
b perpendicular to this line and which passes through the point  $(-3,1)$ .

**解答**: Answers
a  $y = mx + c$
$$
\begin{array}{l} m = - \frac {3}{2} \\ c = 0 \\ \end{array}
$$

### 13 (例题)

**题目**: WORKED EXAMPLE 13
Expand and simplify.
a  $(x + 6)(x + 12)$
b  $(x + 4)(x - 13)$

**解答**: Answers
a  $(x + 6)(x + 12) = x^{2} + 18x + 72$
$6 + 12 = 18$  and  $6 \times 12 = 72$  so this gives  $18x$  and  $72$ .
b  $(x + 4)(x - 13) = x^{2} - 9x - 52$
$4 + -13 = -9$  and  $4 \times -13 = -52$  so this gives  $-9x$  and  $-52$ .

### 14 (例题)

**题目**: WORKED EXAMPLE 14
Factorise completely:
a  $x^{2} + 7x + 12$
b  $x^{2} - 6x - 16$
$x^{2} - 8x + 15$
d  $2x^{2} + 14x + 20$

**解答**: Answers
a  $12 = 1\times 12$
You need two numbers that multiply to give 12 and add to give 7.
$$
1 2 = 2 \times 6
$$
These don't add to give 7.
$$
1 2 = 3 \times 4 \text {a n d} 3 + 4 = 7
$$
These don't add to give 7.
$$
S _ {0}, x ^ {2} + 7 x + 1 2 = (x + 3) (x + 4)
$$
These multiply to give 12 and add to give 7.
b -8x2=-16and-8+2=-6
$$
S _ {0}, x ^ {2} - 6 x - 1 6 = (x - 8) (x + 2)
$$
You need two numbers that multiply to give -16 and add to give -6.
Since they multiply to give a negative answer, one of the numbers must be negative and the other must be positive. (Since they add to give a negative number, the larger of the two numbers must be negative.)
c  $-5\times -3 = 15$  and  $-5 + - 3 = -8$
$$
S _ {0}, x ^ {2} - 8 x + 1 5 = (x - 3) (x - 5)
$$
You need two numbers that multiply to give 15 and add to give -8. Since they multiply to give a positive value but add to give a negative then both must be negative.
d  $2x^{2} + 14x + 20$
$$
= 2 (x ^ {2} + 7 x + 1 0)
$$
$$
= 2 (x + 5) (x + 2)
$$
There is a common factor of 2 in all the terms.
Remove this then find the factors that give 7 and 10.
$$
5 \times 2 = 1 0 \text {a n d} 5 + 2 = 7
$$

**题目**: WORKED EXAMPLE 15
Factorise the following using the difference between two squares:
a  $x^{2} - 49$

**解答**: a  $49 = 7^{2}$
$$
\begin{array}{l} x ^ {2} - 4 9 = x ^ {2} - 7 ^ {2} \\ = (x - 7) (x + 7) \\ \end{array}
$$
Use the formula for the difference between two squares:
$$
x ^ {2} - a ^ {2} = (x - a) (x + a).
$$
You know that  $\sqrt{49} = 7$  so you can write 49 as  $7^{2}$ . This gives you  $a^2$ . Substitute  $7^2$  into the formula.

---

### 16 (例题)

**题目**: b x²-1 4

**解答**: b  $\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^{2} = \frac{1}{4}$
$$
\begin{array}{l} x ^ {2} - \frac {1}{4} = x ^ {2} - \left(\frac {1}{2}\right) ^ {2} \\ = \left(x - \frac {1}{2}\right) \left(x + \frac {1}{2}\right) \\ \end{array}
$$
$\sqrt{\frac{1}{4}}$  is  $\frac{1}{2}$  so you can rewrite  $\frac{1}{4}$  as  $\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^2$
and substitute it into the formula for the difference between two squares.

### 17 (例题)

$$
$$
(5 w) ^ {2} = 5 w \times 5 w = 2 5 w ^ {2}
$$
$$
2 5 w ^ {2} = (5 w) ^ {2}
$$
$$
1 6 y ^ {2} - 2 5 w ^ {2} = (4 y) ^ {2} - (5 w) ^ {2}
$$
Substitute in  $(4y)^2$  and  $(5w)^2$
$$

### WORKED EXAMPLE 17 (例题)

**题目**: WORKED EXAMPLE 17
Solve each of the following equations for  $x$ .
a  $x^{2} - 3x = 0$
b  $x^{2} - 7x + 12 = 0$
$x^{2} + 6x - 4 = 12$
d  $x^{2} - 8x + 16 = 0$

**解答**: a  $x^{2} - 3x = 0$
$$
x (x - 3) = 0
$$
Now the key point:
If two or more quantities multiply to give zero, then at least one of the quantities must be zero.
So either  $x = 0$  or  $x - 3 = 0 \Rightarrow x = 3$ .
Check:  $0^2 - 3 \times 0 = 0$  (this works).
$3^{2} - 3 \times 3 = 9 - 9 = 0$  (this also works)
In fact both  $x = 0$  and  $x = 3$  are solutions.
b  $x^{2} - 7x + 12 = 0$
$$
(x - 4) (x - 3) = 0
$$
Therefore either  $x - 4 = 0 \Rightarrow x = 4$ .
$$
\text {o r} x - 3 = 0 \Rightarrow x = 3.
$$
Again, there are two possible values of  $x$ .

### 18 (例题)

**题目**: WORKED EXAMPLE 18
Solve the equation  $\frac{x}{x + 3} = \frac{8}{x + 6}$

**解答**: $$
x (x + 6) = 8 (x + 3)
$$
Multiply both sides by  $(x + 6)(x + 2)$
$$
x ^ {2} + 6 x = 8 x + 2 4
$$
Expand the brackets. Note there is now a term with  $x^2$ .
$$
x ^ {2} - 2 x = 2 4
$$
Subtract 8x from both sides.
$$
x ^ {2} - 2 x - 2 4 = 0
$$
Subtract 24 from both sides.
$$
(x - 6) (x + 4) = 0
$$
Factorise the quadratic expression.
Either  $x - 6 = 0 \Rightarrow x = 6$
Or  $x + 4 = 0\Rightarrow x = -4$

**解答**: Answer
Check to see if Pythagoras' theorem is satisfied:
$$
c ^ {2} = a ^ {2} + b ^ {2}
$$
$$
a ^ {2} + b ^ {2} = 3. 1 ^ {2} + 4. 2 ^ {2} = 2 7. 2 5
$$
$$
c ^ {2} = 5. 3 ^ {2} = 2 8. 0 9 \neq 2 7. 2 5
$$
Pythagoras' theorem is not satisfied, so the triangle is not right angled.

**解答**: Answer
Angle ACB = 180° - 27° - 108° = 45°
Angle FED = 180° - 45° - 108° = 27°
Both triangles have exactly the same three angles, so they are similar.
Since the triangles are similar:  $\frac{DE}{AB} = \frac{EF}{BC} = \frac{DF}{AC}$
So:  $\frac{y}{8} = \frac{18}{6} = 3 \Rightarrow y = 24 \mathrm{~m}$
and:  $\frac{9}{x} = \frac{18}{6} = 3 \Rightarrow x = 3m$

**解答**: WORKED EXAMPLE 6 CONTINUED
Answer
Consider triangles ABG and AEF:
![image](images/72f9aac55646aa8da6a41288b7c50b2cb7e955579e7fe5203ad43b106ae2b331.jpg)
![image](images/6225052f785f8cc97ba4a26bab84fec4421649a5c79c75d1dffb20cb9f8dc848.jpg)
Angle BAG = FAE
Common to both triangles.
Angle AGB = AEF = 90°
Angle ABG = AFE
BG and FE are both vertical, hence parallel lines.
Angles correspond.
Therefore triangle ABG is similar to triangle AEF.
So:  $\frac{\text{height}}{0.9} = \frac{3}{1.2} \Rightarrow \text{height} = \frac{0.9 \times 3}{1.2} = 2.25 \text{m}$

### WORKED EXAMPLE 7 (例题)

**题目**: WORKED EXAMPLE 7
Ahmed has two rectangular flags. One measures  $1000\mathrm{mm}$  by  $500\mathrm{mm}$ , the other measures  $500\mathrm{mm}$  by  $350\mathrm{mm}$ . Are the flags similar in shape?

**解答**: Answer
$$
\frac {1 0 0 0}{5 0 0} = 2 \text {a n d} \frac {5 0 0}{3 5 0} = 1. 4 3
$$
Work out the ratio of corresponding sides.
$$
\frac {1 0 0 0}{5 0 0} \neq \frac {5 0 0}{3 5 0}
$$
The ratio of corresponding sides is not equal, therefore the shapes are not similar.

**解答**: Answer
Using the ratios of corresponding sides:  $\frac{x}{12} = \frac{20}{8} = 2.5$
$$
\Rightarrow x = 1 2 \times 2. 5 = 3 0 m

**解答**: Answer
Scale factor of lengths  $= \frac{12}{3} = 4$ $\Rightarrow$  Scale factor of volumes  $= 4^{3} = 64$
So the volume of the larger cone  $= 64 \times 40 = 2560 \, \text{cm}^3$ .

## 11 Pythagoras' theorem and similar shapes > 11.4 Understanding congruence

### 11.4 Understanding congruence (例题)

**题目**: Two shapes are congruent if they are the same shape and size.
MATHEMATICAL CONNECTIONS
You will meet rotations and reflections in Chapter 19. When an object is reflected or rotated its shape and size remain unchanged. The resulting object is congruent to the original.
If two shapes are congruent then:
corresponding sides are equal in length.
corresponding angles are equal
the shapes have the same area.
Look at these pairs of congruent shapes. The corresponding sides and angles on each shape are marked using the same colours and symbols.

What is Gadl's total score after six tests?
b What is Gad's mean average score after seven tests?

**解答**: Answers
a Since mean= total of all data number of values
them, total of all data = mean × number of values
$$
\begin{array}{l} = 4 8 \times 6 \\ = 2 8 8 \\ \end{array}
$$
Total of all seven scores  $=$  total of first six plus seventh
$$

Two groups of athletes want to compare their  $100\mathrm{m}$  sprint times. Each person runs once and records their time in seconds.
[Table Row] <tr><td>Team Pythagoras</td><td>14.3</td><td>16.6</td><td>14.3</td><td>17.9</td><td>14.1</td><td>15.7</td></tr>
[Table Row] <tr><td>Team Socrates</td><td>13.2</td><td>16.8</td><td>14.7</td><td>14.7</td><td>13.6</td><td>16.2</td></tr>
a Calculate the mean 100m time for each team.
b Which is the smaller mean?
c What does this tell you about the  $100\mathrm{m}$  times for Team Pythagoras compared to those for Team Socrates?
d Calculate the range for each team.
e What does this tell you about the performance of each team?

**解答**: Answers
a Team Pythagoras:
$$
\text {M e a n} = \frac {1 4 . 3 + 1 6 . 6 + 1 4 . 3 + 1 7 . 9 + 1 4 . 1 + 1 5 . 7}{6} = \frac {9 2 . 9}{6} = 1 5. 4 8 \text {s e c o n d s}
$$
$$
\text {M e a n} = \frac {1 3 . 2 + 1 6 . 8 + 1 4 . 7 + 1 4 . 7 + 1 3 . 6 + 1 6 . 2}{6} = \frac {8 9 . 2}{6} = 1 4. 8 7 \text {s e c o n d s}
$$
b Team Socrates have the smaller mean 100m time.
c The smaller time means that Team Socrates are slightly faster as a team than Team Pythagoras.
d Team Pythagoras' range  $= 17.9 - 14.1 = 3.8$  seconds Team Socrates' range  $= 16.8 - 13.2 = 3.6$  seconds
e Team Socrates are slightly faster as a whole and they are slightly more consistent.

### 2 (练习题)

**题目**: 2 Here is one student's answer to the homework activity.
What mark would you give this student out of 10? Why?
1 a Mean  $=$  sum of values/number of values  $= 8394 / 48$ $= 174.88$  visits per hour (2 dp.) Median  $= (179 + 183) / 2 = 181$  visits per hour Mode  $= 148$  b Range  $= 238 - 100 = 138$
2 The website consistently gets over 100 visits per hour with an average of 175 visits per hour.
3 The mean number of visits to Company B's website is a bit higher than Company A's but the median number of visits to Company B is much lower. This suggests that the mean of Company B is affected by a few high values and the usual number of visits is actually lower. The data for Company B has quite a wide range and this suggests that the data is spread out and the number of visits per hour is less consistent than for Company A.

### WORKED EXAMPLE 4 (例题)

**题目**: WORKED EXAMPLE 4
The heights of 100 children were measured in cm and the results recorded in a table.
[Table Row] <tr><td>Height in cm (h)</td><td>Frequency (f)</td></tr>
[Table Row] <tr><td>120 &lt; h ≤ 130</td><td>12</td></tr>
[Table Row] <tr><td>130 &lt; h ≤ 140</td><td>16</td></tr>
[Table Row] <tr><td>140 &lt; h ≤ 150</td><td>38</td></tr>
[Table Row] <tr><td>150 &lt; h ≤ 160</td><td>24</td></tr>
[Table Row] <tr><td>160 &lt; h ≤ 170</td><td>10</td></tr>
Find:
a an estimate for the mean height of the children
b the modal class.

**解答**: Answers
a You don't know any of the children's heights exactly, so you use the midpoint of each class as the best estimate of the height of each child in that class. For example, the 12 children in the  $120 \leq h < 130$  class have heights between  $120\mathrm{cm}$  and  $130\mathrm{cm}$ , but that is all that you know.
Halfway between  $120\mathrm{cm}$  and  $130\mathrm{cm}$  is  $\frac{(120 + 130)}{2} = 125\mathrm{cm}$ .
A good estimate of the total height of the 12 children in this class is  $12 \times 125$  (frequency  $\times$  midpoint).
Extend your table to include midpoints and totals for each class:
[Table Row] <tr><td>Height in cm (h)</td><td>Frequency (f)</td><td>Midpoint (x)</td><td>Frequency x midpoint (fx)</td></tr>
[Table Row] <tr><td>120 &lt; h ≤ 130</td><td>12</td><td>125</td><td>12 × 125 = 1500</td></tr>
[Table Row] <tr><td>130 &lt; h ≤ 140</td><td>16</td><td>135</td><td>16 × 135 = 2160</td></tr>
[Table Row] <tr><td>140 &lt; h ≤ 150</td><td>38</td><td>145</td><td>38 × 145 = 5510</td></tr>
[Table Row] <tr><td>150 &lt; h ≤ 160</td><td>24</td><td>155</td><td>24 × 155 = 3720</td></tr>
[Table Row] <tr><td>160 &lt; h ≤ 170</td><td>10</td><td>165</td><td>10 × 165 = 1650</td></tr>
An estimate for the mean height of the children is:
$$
\frac {1 5 0 0 + 2 1 6 0 + 5 5 1 0 + 3 7 2 0 + 1 6 5 0}{1 2 + 1 6 + 3 8 + 2 4 + 1 0} = \frac {1 4 5 4 0}{1 0 0} = 1 4 5. 4 \mathrm {c m}
$$
b The class with the highest frequency is the modal class. In this case it is the class:  $140 < h \leqslant 150$ .

### WORKED EXAMPLE 5 (例题)

**题目**: WORKED EXAMPLE 5
For each set of data calculate the median, upper quartile, lower quartile and the interquartile range.
a 13 12 8 6 11 14 8 5 1 10 16 12
b 14 10 8 19 15 14 9

**解答**: Answer
a First sort the data into ascending order:
1568810111212131416
There are an even number of items (12). So, to find the median, find the mean of the middle pair. The first of the pair is in position  $\frac{12}{2} = 6$ , so the median is  $\frac{(10 + 11)}{2} = 10.5$ .
Calculate the position of the quartiles:
$$
\frac {1}{4} (1 2 + 1) = 3. 2 5 \text {a n d} \frac {3}{4} (1 2 + 1) = 9. 7 5
$$
These are not whole numbers, so the lower quartile is the mean of the 3rd and 4th values, and the upper quartile is the mean of the 9th and 10th values.
$$
Q _ {1} \frac {(6 + 8)}{2} = 7 \text {a n d} Q _ {3} = \frac {(1 2 + 1 3)}{2} = 1 2. 5
$$
Then you know that the IQR = 12.5 - 7 = 5.5.
b The ordered data is:
891014141519
There is an odd number of data values, so the median is in position  $\frac{(7 + 1)}{2} = 4$ . The median is 14.
WORKED EXAMPLE 5 CONTINUED
There are seven items, so the positions of the quartiles are:  $\frac{1}{4} (7 + 1) = 2$  and  $\frac{3}{4} (7 + 1) = 6$ .
These are whole numbers so the lower quartile is in position two and the upper quartile is in position six.
So  $Q_{1} = 9$  and  $Q_{3} = 15$ .
IQR=15-9=6

### WORKED EXAMPLE 6 (例题)

**题目**: WORKED EXAMPLE 6
Two companies sell sunflower seeds. In one year, seeds from Allbright produce flowers with a median height of 98 cm and IQR of 13 cm. In the same year seeds from Barstows produce flowers with a median height of 95 cm and IQR of 4 cm. Which seeds would you buy if you wanted to enter a competition for growing the tallest sunflower and why?

**解答**: Answer
I would buy Barstows' seeds. Although Allbright sunflowers seem taller (with a higher median) they are less consistent. So, there is a chance of a very big sunflower, but there is also a good chance of a small sunflower. Barstows' sunflowers are a bit shorter, but are more consistent in their heights so you are more likely to get flowers around the height of 95 cm.

WORKED EXAMPLE 7 CONTINUED
a Determine the median for each group.
b Find the range for:
i vegetarians
ii non-vegetarians.
c Determine the interquartile range for:
i vegetarians
ii non-vegetarians.
d LDL levels of  $<  130$  are desirable, levels of 130-160 are considered borderline high and levels  $>160$  are considered high risk. Using these figures, comment on what the distribution on the stem-and-leaf diagram suggests.

**解答**: Answer
a The data is already ordered and there are 35 values in each set.
$$
\frac {1}{2} (3 5 + 1) = 1 8, \text {s o t h e m e d i a n i s t h e 1 8 t h v a l u e}.
$$
Median  $= 128$  for vegetarians
ii Median  $= 164$  for non-vegetarians
b i Range  $= 173 - 90 = 83$  for vegetarians
ii Range  $= 215 - 112 = 103$  for non-vegetarians
c Determine the position of  $Q_{1}$  and  $Q_{3}$
The lower quartile  $= \frac{1}{4} (35 + 1) = 9$ th value
The upper quartile  $= \frac{3}{4} (35 + 1) = 27$ th value
IQR = Q3 - Q1 = 142 - 116 = 26 for vegetarians
ii  $IQR = Q_{3} - Q_{1} = 180 - 145 = 35$  for non-vegetarians.
d For vegetarians the data is skewed toward the lower levels on the stem- and-leaf diagram. More than half of the values are in the desirable range, with only three in the high-risk range. For non-vegetarians, the data is more spread out. Only three values are in the desirable range, 12 are borderline high and 20 are in the high-risk category.
This might suggest that non-vegetarians have higher levels of bad cholesterol in general. However, without considering other risk factors or medical history, you cannot say this for certain from one set of data.

### WORKED EXAMPLE 7 CONTINUED (例题)

**题目**: WORKED EXAMPLE 7 CONTINUED
a Determine the median for each group.
b Find the range for:
i vegetarians
ii non-vegetarians.
c Determine the interquartile range for:
i vegetarians
ii non-vegetarians.
d LDL levels of  $<  130$  are desirable, levels of 130-160 are considered borderline high and levels  $>160$  are considered high risk. Using these figures, comment on what the distribution on the stem-and-leaf diagram suggests.

**解答**: Answer
a The data is already ordered and there are 35 values in each set.
$$
\frac {1}{2} (3 5 + 1) = 1 8, \text {s o t h e m e d i a n i s t h e 1 8 t h v a l u e}.
$$
Median  $= 128$  for vegetarians
ii Median  $= 164$  for non-vegetarians
b i Range  $= 173 - 90 = 83$  for vegetarians
ii Range  $= 215 - 112 = 103$  for non-vegetarians
c Determine the position of  $Q_{1}$  and  $Q_{3}$
The lower quartile  $= \frac{1}{4} (35 + 1) = 9$ th value
The upper quartile  $= \frac{3}{4} (35 + 1) = 27$ th value
IQR = Q3 - Q1 = 142 - 116 = 26 for vegetarians
ii  $IQR = Q_{3} - Q_{1} = 180 - 145 = 35$  for non-vegetarians.
d For vegetarians the data is skewed toward the lower levels on the stem- and-leaf diagram. More than half of the values are in the desirable range, with only three in the high-risk range. For non-vegetarians, the data is more spread out. Only three values are in the desirable range, 12 are borderline high and 20 are in the high-risk category.
This might suggest that non-vegetarians have higher levels of bad cholesterol in general. However, without considering other risk factors or medical history, you cannot say this for certain from one set of data.

### WORKED EXAMPLE 1 (例题)

**题目**: WORKED EXAMPLE 1
Express:
a 5km in cm
b 3.2cm in m
2000000cm² in m².

**解答**: Answers
a  $1\mathrm{km} = 1000\mathrm{m} = 1000\times 100\mathrm{cm} = 100000\mathrm{cm}$
So.  $5\mathrm{km} = 5\times 100000\mathrm{cm} = 500000\mathrm{cm}$
b  $100\mathrm{cm} = 1\mathrm{m}$  so  $1\mathrm{cm} = 0.01\mathrm{m}$
So,  $3.2\mathrm{cm} = 3.2 \times 0.01 = 0.032\mathrm{m}$
$1\mathrm{m}^2 = 100\mathrm{cm}\times 100\mathrm{cm} = 10000\mathrm{cm}^2$
So,  $2000000\mathrm{cm}^2 = \frac{2000000}{10000} = 200\mathrm{m}^2$

## 13 Understanding measurement > 13.2 Time

### WORKED EXAMPLE 4 (例题)

**题目**: How much time passes from 19:35 on Monday to 03:55 on Tuesday?

**解答**: Answer
19:35 to 24:00 is one part and 00:00 to 03:55 the next day is the other part.
A good way to start this problem is to divide the time into parts.
Part one:
19:35 to 20:00 is 25 minutes  
20:00 to 24:00 is 4 hours  
So, 19:35 to 24:00 is 4 h 25 min
Work out how much time passes to reach midnight.
Part two:
0:00 to 03:55 is 3 h 55 min
03:55 is 3 hours and 55 minutes past midnight.
4h 25min + 3h 55min = 7h 80min = 8h 20min
Add the result of the two parts together.
The total time is 8 hours and 20 minutes.
80 minutes = 1 hour 20 minutes

### WORKED EXAMPLE 8 (例题)

**题目**: If  $a = 3.6$  (to 1 d.p.) and  $b = 14$  (to the nearest whole number), find the upper and lower bounds for each of the following:
a a+b
b ab
c b-a
d  $\frac{a}{b}$
a+b

**解答**: First, find the upper and lower bounds of  $a$  and  $b$ :
$$
3. 5 5 \leqslant a <   3. 6 5 \text {a n d} 1 3. 5 \leqslant b <   1 4. 5
$$
a Upper bound for  $(a + b) =$  upper bound of  $a +$  upper bound of  $b$
$$
\begin{array}{l} = 3. 6 5 + 1 4. 5 \\ = 1 8. 1 5 \\ \end{array}
$$
Lower bound for  $(a + b) =$  lower bound for  $a +$  lower bound for  $b$
$$
\begin{array}{l} = 3. 5 5 + 1 3. 5 \\ = 1 7. 0 5 \\ \end{array}
$$
You can write this as:  $17.05 \leqslant (a + b) < 18.15$
b Upper bound for ab = upper bound for a  $\times$  upper bound for b
$$
\begin{array}{l} = 3. 6 5 \times 1 4. 5 \\ = 5 2. 9 2 5 \\ \end{array}
$$
Lower bound for  $ab =$  lower bound of  $a \times$  lower bound of  $b$
$$
\begin{array}{l} = 3. 5 5 \times 1 3. 5 \\ = 4 7. 9 2 5 \\ \end{array}
$$
You can write this as:  $47.925 \leqslant ab < 52.925$
c Think carefully about  $b - a$  .To find the upper bound you need to subtract the smallest possible number from the largest possible number. So:
Upper bound for  $(b - a) =$  upper bound for  $b -$  lower bound for a
$$
\begin{array}{l} = 1 4. 5 - 3. 5 5 \\ = 1 0. 9 5 \\ \end{array}
$$
For the lower bound, subtract the largest possible number from the smallest possible number:
Lower bound for  $(b - a) =$  lower bound for  $b$  - upper bound for a
$$
\begin{array}{l} = 1 3. 5 - 3. 6 5 \\ = 9. 8 5 \\ \end{array}
$$
You can write this as:  $9.85 \leqslant (b - a) < 10.95$
d To find the upper bound of  $\frac{a}{b}$  you need to divide the largest possible value of  $a$  by the smallest possible value of  $b$ :
$$
\text {U p p e r b o u n d} = \frac {\text {u p p e r b o u n d f o r a}}{\text {l o w e r b o u n d f o r b}} = \frac {3 . 6 5}{1 3 . 5} = 0. 2 7 0 3 \dots = 0. 2 7 0 (3 \text {s . f .})
$$
$$
\text {L o w e r b o u n d} = \frac {\text {l o w e r b o u n d f o r} a}{\text {u p p e r b o u n d f o r} b} = \frac {3 . 5 5}{1 4 . 5} = 0. 2 4 4 8 \dots = 0. 2 4 5 (3 \text {s . f .})
$$
You can write this as:  $0.245 \leq \frac{a}{b} < 0.270$

![image](images/93190c418fe1d799e7dea3cfd420309c1bfd58add16dd0e1fac5765a944198fc.jpg)
For the first equation:
$$
\begin{array}{l} i f x = 0, - 3 y = 6 \Rightarrow y = - 2 \\ a n d, i f y = 0, x = 6 \\ \end{array}
$$
So this line passes through the points  $(0, -2)$  and  $(6, 0)$ .
For the second equation:
$$
i f x = 0, y = 5
$$
$$
\text {a n d , i f} y = 0, 2 x = 5 \Rightarrow x = \frac {5}{2}
$$
So this line passes through the points (0, 5) and  $\left(\frac{5}{2}, 0\right)$ .

### WORKED EXAMPLE 3 (例题)

**题目**: WORKED EXAMPLE 3
Solve the following pair of equations using elimination:
$$
x - y = 4 \tag {1}
$$
$$
x + y = 6 \tag {2}
$$

**解答**: Answer
$x - y = 4$  [1] You can add the two equations together by adding the  $x + y = 6$  [2] left-hand sides and adding the right-hand sides.
$$
2 x = 1 0
$$
$$
\begin{array}{l} 2 x = 1 0 \\ \Rightarrow x = \frac {1 0}{2} \\ x = 5 \\ \end{array}
$$
Notice that the equation that comes from this addition no longer contains a  $y$  term, so you can now solve to find the value of  $x$ .
$x + y = 6$  [2] You now need to find the  $y$  -value that goes with this  $5 + y = 6$  value of  $x$  .Substitute  $x$  into equation [2].
$$
y = 1
$$
$x - y = 5 - 1 = 4$  Check that these values for  $x$  and  $y$  work in equation [1].
Both equations are satisfied by the pair of values  $x = 5$  and  $y = 1$

### WORKED EXAMPLE 4 (例题)

**题目**: WORKED EXAMPLE 4
Solve the following pairs of simultaneous equations:
$$
\begin{array}{l} 2 x - 3 y = - 8 \quad [ 1 ] \\ 5 x + 3 y = 1 \tag {2} \\ \end{array}
$$

**解答**: Answer
$$
\begin{array}{l} 2 x - 3 y = - 8 \\ 5 x + 3 y = 1 \\ 7 x = - 7 [ 1 ] + [ 2 ] \\ \Rightarrow x = - 1 \\ \end{array}
$$
Notice that both equations have the same coefficient of  $y$  though the signs are different. If you add the equations together, you make use of the fact that  $-3y + 3y = 0$
TIP
Always line up' x's with 'x's, y's with 'y's and  $\mathbf{\Pi}^{\prime} = \mathbf{\Pi}^{\prime}$  with  $\mathbf{\Pi}^{\prime} = \mathbf{\Pi}^{\prime}$
It will make your method clearer.
WORKED EXAMPLE 4 CONTINUED
$$
\begin{array}{l} 2 x - 3 y = - 8 \\ \Rightarrow 2 (- 1) - 3 y = - 8 \\ 6 - 3 y = 0 \\ 3 y = 6 \\ y = 2 \\ \end{array}
$$
Substitute in [1]
Now you know the value of  $x$ , you can substitute this into either equation and solve for  $y$ .
$$
\begin{array}{l} 5 x + 3 y = 5 (- 1) + 3 (2) \\ = - 5 + 6 = 1 \\ \end{array}
$$
Check your values in equation [2] to be sure.
The second equation is also satisfied by these values, so  $x = -1$  and  $y = 2$ .

Solve simultaneously:
$$
\begin{array}{l} 4 x + y = - 1 \tag {1} \\ 7 x + y = - 4 \quad [ 2 ] \\ \end{array}

**解答**: Answer
$$
\begin{array}{l} 7 x + y = - 4 \quad [ 2 ] - [ 1 ] \\ 4 x + y = - 1 \\ 3 x = - 3 \\ \Rightarrow x = - 1 \\ \end{array}
$$
The  $y$ -values have the same coefficient again, but this time they have the same sign. Use the fact that  $y - y = 0$  and subtract one equation from the other. There are more 'x's in equation [2] so, consider [2] - [1].
$$
4 x + y = - 1
$$
[1]
Substitute into equation [1].
$$
\begin{array}{l} \Rightarrow 4 (- 1) + y = - 1 \\ y = 3 \\ \end{array}
$$
$$
7 x + y = 7 (- 1) + 3
$$
Check that the values  $x = -1$  and  $y = 3$  work in equation [2].
Equation [2] is also satisfied by these values, so  $x = -1$  and  $y = 3$ .

$$

**解答**: Answer
$$
3 x - 4 y = 2 0
$$
In this pair of equations it makes sense to remove the fractions before you work with them. Multiply both sides of equation [1] by 2.
$$
3 x + 2 y = 8
$$
Multiply both sides of equation [2] by 4.
WORKED EXAMPLE 8 CONTINUED
$3x - 4y = 20$  [3] - [4] Subtract equation [4] from equation [3].
$$
\begin{array}{l} 3 x + 2 y = 8 \\ - 6 y = 1 2 \\ y = - 2 \\ \end{array}
$$
$3x - 4(-2) = 20$  Substitute the value for  $y$  into equation [3].
$$
\begin{array}{l} 3 x + 8 = 2 0 \\ 3 x = 1 2 \\ x = 4 \\ \end{array}
$$
3(4) + 2(-2) = 12 - 4 = 8 Check using equation [4].
So  $x = 4$  and  $y = -2$  satisfy the pair of simultaneous equations.

**解答**: Answers
a i The values of  $x$  have to be larger than 3.  $x$  cannot be equal to 3, so do not fill in the circle. 'Greater than' means 'to the right' on the number line.
![image](images/e75d9062bbc904aea962d7f06d09089a1a14c25125f928eb574259fd85a43b28.jpg)
ii Notice that  $y$  is now being used as the variable and this should be clearly labelled on your number line. Also, two inequality symbols have been used. In fact there are two inequalities, and both must be satisfied.
$4 < y$  means that  $y$  is greater than (but not equal) to 4.
$y < 8$  means that  $y$  is less than (but not equal to) 8.
So,  $y$  lies between 4 and 8 (not inclusive):
![image](images/9157f954a26a4a567a42ba3ab6b402964dcb6cebe9166e425bc150c3215ec2ba.jpg)
iii This example has two inequalities that must both be satisfied.  $x$  is greater than (but not equal to) -1.4, and  $x$  is less than or equal to 2.8:
![image](images/c67e4701dc34ee0a793028904c4a02b8f205295ed4a17d8693ec0316aa7c1081.jpg)
b  $x$  must be greater than, but not equal to 4.2, so the smallest possible value of  $x$  is 5.  $x$  must also be less than or equal to 10.4, so the largest possible value of  $x$  is 10.

c  $5x - 3\leqslant 2x + 18$
d  $4 - 7x\leqslant 53$
e  $-10\leqslant 3x - 2 <   4$

**解答**: Answers
a  $3x - 4 <   14$
$$
3 x <   1 8
$$
Add 4 to both sides.
$$
\frac {3 x}{3} <   \frac {1 8}{3}
$$
Divide both sides by 3.
$$
\mathrm {S o}, x <   6
$$
b  $4(x - 7)\geq 16$
$4x - 28\geq 16$
$$
4 x \geqslant 4 4
$$
$$
\frac {4 x}{4} \geqslant \frac {4 4}{4}
$$
$$
\mathrm {S o}, x \geqslant 1 1
$$
$$
4 (x - 7) \geqslant 1 6
$$
$$
x - 7 \geqslant 4
$$
$$
x \geqslant 1 1
$$
Expand the brackets.
Add 28 to both sides.
Divide both sides by 4.
You can also solve this inequality by dividing both sides by 4 at the beginning:
Divide both sides by 4.
Add 7 to both sides to get the same answer as before.

### WORKED EXAMPLE 11 (例题)

**题目**: On a diagram, show the regions that represent the inequalities  $2x - 3y < 6$  and  $2x - 3y > 6$ .
![Answer](images/64b5f63914b1cd57f133ad0bb3881b09783413ec59155866f18269e3ce682a8b.jpg)
The boundary between the two required regions is the line  $2x - 3y = 6$
This line crosses the  $x$ -axis at  $(3,0)$  and the  $y$ -axis at  $(0, -2)$ . It is shown as a broken line in the diagram.
Consider any point in the region above the line. The easiest point to use is the origin  $(0,0)$ . When  $x = 0$  and  $y = 0$ ,  $2x - 3y = 0$ . Since 0 is less than 6, the region above the line represents the inequality  $2x - 3y < 6$ .

### WORKED EXAMPLE 12 (例题)

**题目**: By shading the unwanted region, show the region that represents the inequality  $3x - 5y \leqslant 15$ .
Answer
![image](images/f331557493516c2de28b36e439b594cf304f074f91a7f203710dda807368e831.jpg)
The boundary line is  $3x - 5y = 15$  and it is included in the region (because the inequality includes equal to).
This line crosses the  $x$  -axis at (5, 0) and crosses the  $y$  -axis at  $(0, - 3)$  .It is shown as a solid line in the diagram.
When  $x = 0$  and  $y = 0$ ,  $3x - 5y = 0$ . Since 0 is less than 15, the origin (0, 0) is in the required region. (Alternatively, rearrange  $3x - 5y \leqslant 15$  to get  $y \geqslant \frac{3}{5}x - 3$  and deduce that the required region is above the line.) The unshaded region in this diagram represents the inequality  $3x - 5y \leqslant 15$ .

### WORKED EXAMPLE 13 (例题)

**题目**: By shading the unwanted region, show the region that represents the inequality  $3x - 2y \geq 0$ .
Answer

You cannot take the origin as the checking point because it lies on the boundary line. Instead take the point  $P(0,2)$ , which is above the line. When  $x = 0$  and  $y = 2$ ,  $3x - 2y = -4$ , which is less than 0. Hence  $P$  is not in the required region.
The boundary line is  $3x - 2y = 0$  and it is included in the region. It is shown as a solid line in the diagram.

### WORKED EXAMPLE 14 (例题)

**题目**: Find the inequality that is represented by the unshaded region in this diagram.

Answer
First find the equation of the boundary. Its gradient  $= \frac{-4}{2} = -2$  and its intercept on the  $y$ -axis is  $y = 4$ . Therefore the boundary line is  $y = -2x + 4$ . This can be rewritten as  $y + 2x = 4$ . Take  $P(3,2)$  in the unshaded region as the check-point:  $2 + 6 = 8$ . Note that 8 is greater than 4 and hence the unshaded region represents  $y + 2x > 4$ . As the boundary is a broken line, it is not included, and so the sign is not  $\geq$ .

**解答**: Answer
The coefficient of  $x$  is -4. Half of this is -2.
So start by thinking about  $(x - 2)^2 = x^2 - 4x + 4$ .

**解答**: Answers
a Try  $(x + 2)^2 = x^2 + 4x + 4$
The coefficient of  $x$  in  $x^2 + 4x - 6$  is 4. Half of this is 2.
$$
\begin{array}{l} (x + 2) ^ {2} - 1 0 = x ^ {2} + 4 x + 4 - 1 0 \\ = x ^ {2} + 4 x - 6 \\ \end{array}

Subtract 10 from both sides to make the constant term  $-6$ .
b  $x^{2} + 4x - 6 = 0$
$$
\begin{array}{l} (x + 2) ^ {2} - 1 0 = 0 \\ (x + 2) ^ {2} = 1 0 \\ x + 2 = \pm \sqrt {1 0} \\ x = - 2 \pm \sqrt {1 0} \\ \end{array}

**题目**: WORKED EXAMPLE 21
Factorise each of the following expressions:
a  $2x^{2} + 3x + 1$

![图片](../images/10b8a4dc765e29520dc525d99e8d1e2f1ba1e27ec1a45b9fd273b8280db077d3.jpg)

**解答**: a  $2x^{2} + 3x + 1$
$$
2 x ^ {2} + 3 x + 1 = (2 x) (x)
$$
The only way to produce the term  $2x^{2}$  is to multiply  $2x$  and  $x$ . Place these two terms at the front of each bracket. There are blank spaces in the brackets because you don't yet know what else needs to be included. The clue lies in the constant term at the end, which is obtained by multiplying these two unknown values together.
The constant term is 1, so the only possible values are +1 or -1. Since the constant term is positive, the unknown values must be either both -1 or both +1.
Try each of these combinations systematically:
$(2x - 1)(x - 1) = 2x^{2} - 3x + 1$
The coefficient of  $x$  is wrong.
$(2x + 1)(x + 1) = 2x^{2} + 3x + 1$
This is correct.
So,  $2x^{2} + 3x + 1 = (2x + 1)(x + 1)$

### 21 (例题)

**题目**: WORKED EXAMPLE 21 CONTINUED
b  $3x^{2} - 14x + 8$

**解答**: Start by writing  $3x^{2} - 14x + 8 = (3x)(x)$
The two unknown terms must multiply to give 8. Since the constant term is positive, the unknowns must have the same sign. The possible pairs are:
8 and 1 2 and 4 -8 and -1 -2 and -4
Try each pair in turn, remembering that you can reverse the order:
$$
(3 x + 8) (x + 1) = 3 x ^ {2} + 3 x + 8 x + 8 = 3 x ^ {2} + 1 1 x + 8 \quad \text {I n c o r r e c t}
$$
$$
(3 x + 1) (x + 8) = 3 x ^ {2} + 2 4 x + x + 8 = 3 x ^ {2} + 2 5 x + 8 \quad \text {I n c o r r e c t}
$$
$$
(3 x + 2) (x + 4) = 3 x ^ {2} + 1 2 x + 2 x + 8 = 3 x ^ {2} + 1 4 x + 8 \quad \text {I n c o r r e c t}
$$
This last one is very close. You just need to change the sign of the 'x' term. This can be done by jumping to the last pair: -2 and -4.
$$
(3 x - 2) (x - 4) = 3 x ^ {2} - 1 2 x - 2 x + 8 = 3 x ^ {2} - 1 4 x + 8 \quad \text {C o r r e c t}
$$
$$
S _ {0}, 3 x ^ {2} - 1 4 x + 8 = (3 x - 2) (x - 4)
$$

### 21 (例题)

**题目**: c  $6x^{2} + 14x - 12 = 2(3x^{2} + 7x - 6)$  Take out the common factor first.

**解答**: Write the pair of brackets; the factors have to be  $3x$  and  $x$ :
$$
6 x ^ {2} + 1 4 x - 1 2 = 2 (3 x) (x)
$$
The two unknown terms must multiply to give  $-6$ , because you have taken out the common factor 2. The possible pairs are:
2 and -3 3 and -2 6 and -1 -6 and 1
Test the pairs until you find the correct combination.
You will find that:
$$
6 x ^ {2} + 1 4 x - 1 2 = 2 (3 x - 2) (x + 3)
$$

### 21 (例题)

**题目**: d  $10x^{2} + 11x - 8$

**解答**: This question requires more thought because there is more than one way to multiply two expressions to get  $10x^{2}$ :
2x and 5x or 10x and x.
Each possibility needs to be tried.
Start with  $10x^{2} + 11x - 8 = (10x)(x)$
Factor pairs that multiply to give -8 are:
-8 and 1 8 and -1 2 and -4 -2 and 4
Remember that you will need to try each pair with the two values in either order.
For this particular quadratic you will find that none of the eight possible combinations works!
Instead, you must now try:  $10x^{2} + 11x - 8 = (5x)(2x)$ .
Trying the above set of pairs once again you will eventually find that:
$$
1 0 x ^ {2} + 1 1 x - 8 = (5 x + 8) (2 x - 1)
$$

Simplify each of the following fractions as far as possible:
3x a 6
b y
12p3 16p7
d  $\frac{x^2 - 4x + 3}{x^2 - 7x + 12}$

**解答**: Answers
a  $\frac{3x}{6}$
$$
\frac {3 x}{6} = \frac {3 x \div 3}{6 \div 3} = \frac {x}{2}
$$
The highest common factor (HCF) of 3 and 6 is 3.
b  $\frac{y^2}{y^5}$
$$
\frac {y ^ {2}}{y ^ {5}} = \frac {y ^ {2} \div y ^ {2}}{y ^ {5} \div y ^ {2}} = \frac {1}{y ^ {3}}
$$
The HCF of  $y^{2}$  and  $y^{3}$  is  $y^{2}$ .
12p3 16p7
$$
\frac {1 2 p ^ {3}}{1 6 p ^ {7}} = \frac {3 p ^ {3}}{4 p ^ {7}}
$$
Consider the constants first.
$$
= \frac {3}{4 p ^ {4}}
$$
The HCF of 12 and 16 is 4, so you can divide both 12 and 16 by 4.
The HCF of  $p^3$  and  $p^7$  is  $p^3$ . You can divide both the numerator and the denominator by this HCF.
d  $\frac{x^2 - 4x + 3}{x^2 - 7x + 12}$
Notice that you can factorise both the numerator and the denominator.
$$
\begin{array}{l} \frac {x ^ {2} - 4 x + 3}{x ^ {2} - 7 x + 1 2} = \frac {(x - 3) (x - 1)}{(x - 3) (x - 4)} \\ = \frac {(x - 3) (x - 1)}{(x - 3) (x - 4)} \\ = \frac {(x - 1)}{(x - 4)} \\ \end{array}
$$
$(x - 3)$  is a factor of both the numerator and the denominator, so you can cancel this common factor.

### 26 (例题)

**题目**: Write as a single fraction in its lowest terms,  $\frac{1}{x + 1} + \frac{1}{x + 2}$

**解答**: Answer
The lowest common multiple of  $(x + 1)$  and  $(x + 2)$  is  $(x + 1)(x + 2)$ .
$$
\begin{array}{l} \frac {1}{x + 1} + \frac {1}{x + 2} = \frac {x + 2}{(x + 1) (x + 2)} + \frac {x + 1}{(x + 1) (x + 2)} \\ = \frac {x + 2 + x + 1}{(x + 1) (x + 2)} \\ = \frac {2 x + 3}{(x + 1) (x + 2)} \\ \end{array}
$$

### 27 (例题)

**题目**: Write as a single fraction in its lowest terms,  $\frac{3x + 4}{x^2 + x - 6} - \frac{1}{x + 3}$

**解答**: Answer
First you should factorise the quadratic expression:
$$
\frac {3 x + 4}{x ^ {2} + x - 6} - \frac {1}{x + 3} = \frac {3 x + 4}{(x + 3) (x - 2)} - \frac {1}{(x + 3)}
$$
The two denominators have a common factor of  $(x + 3)$ , and the lowest common multiple of these two denominators is  $(x + 3)(x - 2)$ :
$$
\begin{array}{l} \frac {3 x + 4}{x ^ {2} + x - 6} - \frac {1}{x + 3} = \frac {3 x + 4}{(x + 3) (x - 2)} - \frac {1}{(x + 3)} \\ = \frac {3 x + 4}{(x + 3) (x - 2)} - \frac {(x - 2)}{(x + 3) (x - 2)} \\ = \frac {3 x + 4 - (x - 2)}{(x + 3) (x - 2)} \\ = \frac {3 x + 4 - x + 2}{(x + 3) (x - 2)} \\ = \frac {2 x + 6}{(x + 3) (x - 2)} \\ \end{array}
$$
This may appear to be the final answer, but if you factorise the numerator you will find that more can be done!
$$
\begin{array}{l} \frac {3 x + 4}{x ^ {2} + x - 6} - \frac {1}{x + 3} = \frac {2 x + 6}{(x + 3) (x - 2)} \\ = \frac {2 (x + 3)}{(x + 3) (x - 2)} \\ = \frac {2}{(x - 2)} \\ \end{array}
$$

### WORKED EXAMPLE 1 (例题)

**题目**: WORKED EXAMPLE 1
A rectangular field is  $100\mathrm{m}$  long and  $45\mathrm{m}$  wide. A scale drawing of the field is made with a scale of  $1\mathrm{cm}$  to  $10\mathrm{m}$ . What are the length and width of the field in the drawing?

**解答**: Answer
10m is represented by 1cm
:  $100\mathrm{m}$  is represented by  $(100\div 10)\mathrm{cm} = 10\mathrm{cm}$
and  $45\mathrm{m}$  is represented by  $(45\div 10)\mathrm{cm} = 4.5\mathrm{cm}$
So, the dimensions on the drawing are: length  $= 10\mathrm{cm}$  and width  $= 4.5\mathrm{cm}$

**解答**: Answer
In the second diagram, the two north lines are parallel. Hence angle  $\theta = 48^{\circ}$  (using the properties of corresponding angles).
The bearing of city A from town  $B = 48^{\circ} + 180^{\circ} = 228^{\circ}$
Notice that the difference between the two bearings  $(48^{\circ}$  and  $228^{\circ})$  is  $180^{\circ}$

To find the angle  $d$ , you could use the fact that the angle sum in a triangle is  $180^\circ$ . This gives  $d = 180^\circ - (90^\circ + 73.7^\circ) = 16.3^\circ$ .
Alternatively, you could use the tangent ratio again but with the opp and adj reassigned to match this angle:
$$
\tan d = \frac {\operatorname {o p p} (d)}{\operatorname {a d j} (d)} = \frac {7}{2 4}
$$
$$
\begin{array}{l} d = \tan^ {- 1} \left(\frac {7}{2 4}\right) \\ = 1 6. 2 6 0 2 0 4 \dots \\ \end{array}
$$
$$
d = 1 6. 3 ^ {\circ} (1 d. p.)

**题目**: WORKED EXAMPLE 11
Find the exact area of the triangle shown in the diagram.
![image](images/7dc93b45e6381c08e5f2340a79dbb9cedac7d606cf07ba4239e8d279f24df3c6.jpg)

**解答**: Answer
First, find the height of the triangle,  $h$
$$
\begin{array}{l} \tan 6 0 ^ {\circ} = \frac {h}{5} \\ \Rightarrow h = 5 \tan 6 0 ^ {\circ} \\ \end{array}
$$
$h = 5\sqrt{3}\mathrm{cm}$  using the exact value of tan  $60^{\circ}$
$$
\begin{array}{l} \text {A r e a} = \frac {1}{2} \times \text {b a s e} \times \text {h e i g h t} \\ = \frac {1}{2} \times 5 \times 5 \sqrt {3} \\ = \frac {2 5 \sqrt {3}}{2} c m ^ {2} \\ \end{array}

**解答**: Answer
The area of a trapezium  $=$  (mean of the parallel sides)  $\times$  (perpendicular distance between them).
In this diagram, perpendiculars have been added to form right-angled triangles so that trigonometry can be used.
![image](images/63197ce0899a10e6cefc2e888ed25830739169183f7b06050214e59d0e69a0f7.jpg)
$AC = MN$  and you can find the length of MN if you calculate the lengths of BM and ND.
In triangle  ${ABM}$  ,  $\sin {60}^{ \circ  } = \frac{\operatorname{opp}\left( {60}^{ \circ  }\right) }{\operatorname{hyp}} = \frac{AM}{4.6}$  and  $\cos {60}^{ \circ  } = \frac{\operatorname{adj}\left( {60}^{ \circ  }\right) }{\operatorname{hyp}} = \frac{BM}{4.6}$
Hence,  $AM = 4.6 \times \sin 60^\circ$  and  $BM = 4.6 \times \cos 60^\circ$
$AM = 3.983716\ldots cm$  and  $BM = 2.3cm$
By symmetry,  $ND = BM = 2.3\mathrm{cm}$
and  $\therefore MN = 8.2 - (2.3 + 2.3) = 3.6\mathrm{cm}$
Hence,  $AC = 3.6$  cm and  $AM = CN = 3.983716 \dots$  cm
The area of  $ABDC = \left(\frac{AC + BD}{2}\right)\times AM$
$$
\begin{array}{l} = \left(\frac {3 . 6 + 8 . 2}{2}\right) \times 3. 9 8 3 7 1 6 \dots \mathrm {c m} ^ {2} \\ = 2 3. 5 0 3 9 2 9 \dots \mathrm {c m} ^ {2} \\ \end{array}
$$
Area of ABDC  $= 23.5\mathrm{cm}^2$  (to 3 s.f.)

**解答**: Answer
Here is a simplified labelled drawing of the bridge, showing the two halves raised to  $35^{\circ}$ .
![image](images/52f5bef079f57fd76fe87cb5e63e5a13da9b07245496a16a4a75c7f1fe2fa40f.jpg)
The gap  $= BD = MN$  and  $MN = AC - (AM + NC)$
The right-angled triangles  $ABM$  and  $CDN$  are congruent, so  $AM = NC$ .
When the two halves are lowered, they must meet in the middle.
$$
\therefore A B = C D = \frac {7 6}{2} = 3 8 m
$$
In triangle ABM, cos  $35^{\circ} = \frac{\text{adj}(35^{\circ})}{\text{hyp}} = \frac{\text{AM}}{38}$
$$
\begin{array}{l} A M = 3 8 \times \cos 3 5 ^ {\circ} \\ = 3 1. 1 2 7 7 \dots m \\ \end{array}
$$
$$
\begin{array}{l} \therefore M N = 7 6 - (3 1. 1 2 7 7 \dots + 3 1. 1 2 7 7 \dots) \\ = 1 3. 7 4 4 \dots m \\ \end{array}
$$
The gap  $BD = 13.7\mathrm{m}$  (to 3 s.f.)

Which acute angle has the same sine as  $120^{\circ}$ ?

**解答**: Answer
$$
\sin (1 8 0 ^ {\circ} - \theta) = \sin \theta
$$
The graph of  $\sin \theta$  gives this relationship.
$$
\sin (1 8 0 ^ {\circ} - 1 2 0 ^ {\circ}) = \sin 1 2 0 ^ {\circ}
$$
Let  $\theta = 120^{\circ}$  and subtract to find another angle with the same sine value.

a cos100°
b -cos  $35^{\circ}$

**解答**: Answers
a cos(180°-0）=-cos0
Start with the general relationship.
$$
\cos (1 8 0 ^ {\circ} - 1 0 0 ^ {\circ}) = - \cos 1 0 0 ^ {\circ}
$$
Let  $\theta = 100^{\circ}$  and subtract.
$$
\cos 8 0 ^ {\circ} = - \cos 1 0 0 ^ {\circ}
$$
So, cos  $100^{\circ} = -\cos 80^{\circ}$
Rearrange to find another value equal to  $\cos 100^{\circ}$
b -cosθ=cos(180°-θ)
$$
- \cos 3 5 ^ {\circ} = \cos 1 4 5 ^ {\circ}

**解答**: Answers
a Use your calculator to find one solution:  $\sin^{-1}\left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\right) = 45^{\circ}.$
Now mark  $\theta = 45$  degrees on a sketch of the graph  $y = \sin \theta$  and draw the line  $y = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}$  like this:
![image](images/298df332f5ff678efc5e4b54ec8730623990ff16e628b3a1f1c304963cae5fa8.jpg)
Using the symmetry of the graph, you can see that there is another solution at  $\theta = 135^{\circ}$ .
Use your calculator to check that sin  $135^{\circ} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}$ .
Notice that  $135^{\circ} = 180^{\circ} - 45^{\circ}$ . You can use this rule, but drawing a sketch graph always makes it easier to understand why there is a second solution.
WORKED EXAMPLE 16 CONTINUED
b Use your calculator to find one solution:  $\tan^{-1}(3) = 71.6^{\circ}$ . As before, mark this on a sketch of the graph  $y = \tan \theta$  and draw the line  $y = 3$ .
![image](images/9910d2ef73831776588efe0b6544e0a64c48e102672b183e6fa95780ddfa66f4.jpg)
You can see that the second solution is  $180^{\circ} + 71.6^{\circ} = 251.6^{\circ}$ . More solutions can be found by adding 180 degrees over and over, but these will all be larger than 360 degrees, so they are not in the range that you want.
c Use your calculator to find one solution:  $\cos^{-1}\left(-\frac{1}{2}\right) = 120^{\circ}$  Draw a sketch and mark the values:
![image](images/d745b24b2c6e08cb9fb3e215234dfd809d9fea5c95eb05b79950d802a866690a.jpg)
You can now see that the second solution will be at  $360^{\circ} - 120^{\circ} = 240^{\circ}$ .
Note that you only need to sketch the part of the graph for 0 to  $360^{\circ}$  because you are only looking for solutions between these two values of  $\theta$ .
There are more solutions, but in the range 0 to  $360^{\circ}$  the line  $y = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}$  only meets the graph  $y = \sin \theta$  twice.

Calculate the size of  $C$  and the lengths of the sides  $AB$  and  $AC$ .

**解答**: Answer
To calculate the angle  $C$ , use the fact that the sum of the three angles in a triangle is always  $180^\circ$
$$
S o, C + 8 0 + 3 0 = 1 8 0 \Rightarrow C = 1 8 0 - 3 0 - 8 0 = 7 0 ^ {\circ}
$$
Now think about the side AB. AB is opposite the angle C (forming an 'opposite pair') and side BC is opposite angle A, forming a second 'opposite pair'.
So, write down the version of the sine rule that uses these pairs:
$$
\begin{array}{l} \frac {a}{\sin A} = \frac {c}{\sin C} \Rightarrow \frac {B C}{\sin A} = \frac {A B}{\sin C} \\ \mathrm {S o}, \frac {1 5}{\sin 8 0 ^ {\circ}} = \frac {A B}{\sin 7 0 ^ {\circ}} \Rightarrow A B \frac {1 5}{\sin 8 0 ^ {\circ}} \times \sin 7 0 ^ {\circ} = 1 4. 3 \mathrm {c m} (3 \mathrm {s . f .}) \\ \end{array}
$$
Similarly:
AC forms an opposite pair with angle B, so once again use the pair BC and angle A:
$$
\begin{array}{l} \frac {a}{\sin A} = \frac {b}{\sin B} \Rightarrow \frac {B C}{\sin A} = \frac {A C}{\sin B} \\ \mathrm {S o}, \frac {1 5}{\sin 8 0 ^ {\circ}} = \frac {A C}{\sin 3 0 ^ {\circ}} \Rightarrow A C \frac {1 5}{\sin 8 0 ^ {\circ}} \times \sin 3 0 ^ {\circ} = 7. 6 2 \mathrm {c m} (3 \mathrm {s . f .}) \\ \end{array}
$$

**解答**: Answer
Notice that  $AC = b$  and you know that  $B = 50^\circ$ .
Use the cosine rule in the form,  $b^{2} = a^{2} + c^{2} - 2ac\cos B$ .
$$
\begin{array}{l} b ^ {2} = 9 ^ {2} + 1 8 ^ {2} - (2 \times 9 \times 1 8 \times \cos 5 0 ^ {\circ}) \\ = 8 1 + 3 2 4 - (2 0 8. 2 6 3 1 \dots) \\ = 1 9 6. 7 3 6 8 \dots \\ \end{array}
$$
$$
\begin{array}{l} \therefore b = \sqrt {1 9 6 . 7 3 6 8 \dots} \\ = 1 4. 0 2 6 2 \dots \\ \end{array}
$$

$$
\begin{array}{l} f ^ {2} = 2 5 ^ {2} + 3 4 ^ {2} - (2 \times 2 5 \times 3 4 \times \cos 1 2 0 ^ {\circ}) \\ = 6 2 5 + 1 1 5 6 - (- 8 5 0) \quad \text {(n o i c e t h a t c o s 1 2 0 ^ {\circ} i s n e g a t i v e)} \\ = 6 2 5 + 1 1 5 6 + 8 5 0 \\ = 2 6 3 1 \\ \end{array}

**解答**: Answers
a  $PQ = r$  , so use the cosine rule in the form,  $r^2 = p^2 +q^2 -2pq\cos R.$
$$
\begin{array}{l} r ^ {2} = 5 ^ {2} + 8 ^ {2} - (2 \times 5 \times 8 \times \cos 1 0 0 ^ {\circ}) \\ = 2 5 + 6 4 - (- 1 3. 8 9 1 8 \dots) \quad \text {(n o i t e t h a t} \cos 1 0 0 ^ {\circ} \text {i s n e g a t e}) \\ = 1 0 2. 8 9 1 8 \dots \\ \end{array}
$$
$$
\begin{array}{l} \therefore r = \sqrt {1 0 2 . 8 9 1 8 \dots} \\ = 1 0. 1 4 3 5 \dots \\ \end{array}
$$
Length of  $PQ = 10.1 \, \text{cm}$  (to 3 s.f.)
WORKED EXAMPLE 21 CONTINUED
b Now you know the value of  $r$  as well as the value of  $R$ , you can use the sine rule:
$$
\begin{array}{l} \frac {\sin P}{P} = \frac {\sin Q}{q} = \frac {\sin R}{r} \\ \frac {\sin P}{5} = \frac {\sin Q}{8} = \frac {\sin 1 0 0 ^ {\circ}}{1 0 . 1 4 3 5 \dots} \\ \end{array}
$$
Using the first and third fractions, sin  $P = \frac{5 \times \sin 100^{\circ}}{10.1435 \dots} = 0.4853 \dots$
$R$  is obtuse so  $P$  is acute, and  $P = 29.0409\dots$
$$
P = 2 9 ^ {\circ} (\text {t o t h e n e a r e s t d e g r e e})
$$
To find  $Q$  you can use the angle sum of a triangle  $= 180^{\circ}$
$$
Q = 1 8 0 ^ {\circ} - (1 0 0 ^ {\circ} + 2 9 ^ {\circ})
$$
:Q=51°(to the nearest degree)

### WORKED EXAMPLE 22 (例题)

**题目**: a Change the subject of the formula  $c^2 = a^2 +b^2 -2ab\cos C$  to cos C.
b Use your answer to part (a) to find the smallest angle in the triangle which has sides of length  $7\mathrm{m},8\mathrm{m}$  and  $13\mathrm{m}$

**解答**: Answers
a  $c^2 = a^2 +b^2 -2ab\cos C$
$$
2 a b \cos C = a ^ {2} + b ^ {2} - c ^ {2}
$$
$$
\cos C = \frac {a ^ {2} + b ^ {2} - c ^ {2}}{2 a b}
$$
b The smallest angle in a triangle is opposite the shortest side. In the given triangle, the smallest angle is opposite the  $7\mathrm{m}$  side. Let this angle be  $C$ .
Then  $c = 7$  and take  $a = 8$  and  $b = 13$ .
Using the result of part (a):
$$
\begin{array}{l} \cos C = \frac {8 ^ {2} + 1 3 ^ {2} - 7 ^ {2}}{2 \times 8 \times 1 3} \\ = \frac {6 4 + 1 6 9 - 4 9}{2 0 8} \\ = \frac {1 8 4}{2 0 8} \\ \end{array}
$$
$$
\begin{array}{l} C = \cos^ {- 1} \frac {1 8 4}{2 0 8} \\ = 2 7. 7 9 5 7 \dots^ {\circ} \\ \end{array}
$$
The smallest angle of the triangle  $= 27.8^{\circ}$  (to 1 d.p.)

## 15 Scale drawings, bearings and trigonometry > 15.9 Trigonometry in three dimensions

### 15.9 (例题)

**题目**: You can also use the trigonometry ratios to solve problems in three dimensions. With problems of this kind you must draw and label each triangle as you use it. This will help you to organise your thoughts and keep your solution tidy.
When you work with solids you may need to calculate the angle between an edge, or a diagonal, and one of the faces. This is called the angle between a line and a plane.
Consider a line  $PQ$ , which meets a plane  $ABCD$  at point  $P$ . Through  $P$  draw lines  $PR_1, PR_2, PR_3, \ldots$  in the plane and consider the angles  $QPR_1, QPR_2, QPR_3 \ldots$

**解答**: Answer
First identify the angle required.  $B$  is the point where the diagonal BS meets the plane ABCD.
${SD}$  is the perpendicular from  $S$  to the plane  ${ABCD}$  and so  ${DB}$  is the projection of  ${SB}$  onto the plane.
![image](images/6c09d83c8d627e9c60e8beb76623f29cdbc7e24b460e60aaec904d34260a6516.jpg)
The angle required is SBD.
You know that triangle SBD has a right angle at  $D$  and that  $SD = 2m$  (equal to AP).
To find angle SBD, you need to know the length of DB or the length of SB. You can find the length of BD by using Pythagoras' theorem in triangle ABD.
![image](images/173a4eb2d278fe9060cc346b4bfea54e0629676a78c2de757143ff2159648714.jpg)
$$
\begin{array}{l} B D ^ {2} = 6 ^ {2} + 4 ^ {2} = 3 6 + 1 6 = 5 2 \\ B D = \sqrt {5 2} \\ \end{array}
$$
So, using right-angled triangle SBD:
$$
\tan B = \frac {\operatorname {o p p} (B)}{\operatorname {a d j} (B)} = \frac {S D}{B D} = \frac {2}{\sqrt {5 2}}
$$
Angle SBD = tan-1(2/√52) = 15.5013...
The angle between diagonal BS and the floor  $ABCD = 15.5^{\circ}$  (to 1 d.p.)

## 16 Scatter diagrams and correlation > 16.1 Introduction to bivariate data

### WORKED EXAMPLE 1 (例题)

**题目**: WORKED EXAMPLE 1
The manager of a shoe shop claims that a person's height can give a very good idea of the length of their foot. To investigate this claim, the manager collects the heights and foot lengths, in cm, of ten people and records the results in a table:
[Table Row] <tr><td>Person</td><td>A</td><td>B</td><td>C</td><td>D</td><td>E</td><td>F</td><td>G</td><td>H</td><td>I</td><td>J</td></tr>
[Table Row] <tr><td>Height (cm)</td><td>156.2</td><td>182.4</td><td>165.3</td><td>155.1</td><td>165.2</td><td>122.9</td><td>176.3</td><td>183.4</td><td>163.0</td><td>143.1</td></tr>
[Table Row] <tr><td>Foot length (cm)</td><td>28.2</td><td>31.1</td><td>22.5</td><td>28.6</td><td>25.4</td><td>13.2</td><td>29.9</td><td>33.4</td><td>22.5</td><td>19.4</td></tr>
a Draw a scatter diagram, with height on the horizontal axis and foot length on the vertical axis.
b State what type of correlation the diagram shows.
c Draw a line of best fit.
d Estimate the foot length of a person with height 164 cm.
Estimate the height of a person with foot length  $17\mathrm{cm}$
f Comment on the likely accuracy of your estimates in parts (d) and (e).

**解答**: Answers
![a Scatter diagram showing the relationship between heights and foot lengths of people](images/8f40a27b2476877b8830c4f126361936f361930857276bb83c397f3ca5f62ad2.jpg)
TIP
When commenting on correlation, always make sure that you refer back to the original context of the question.
WORKED EXAMPLE 1 CONTINUED
b This is a strong positive correlation because foot length generally increases with height. We can make good predictions of foot length from someone's height and good predictions of someone's height from their foot length.
c The line of best fit is drawn on the diagram. The line should extend across the entire data set and there should be approximately equal numbers of points on either side of the line.
d The appropriate lines are drawn on the diagram. A height of  $164\mathrm{cm}$  corresponds to a foot length of approximately  $26\mathrm{cm}$ .
e A foot length of  $17\mathrm{cm}$  corresponds to a height of approximately  $132\mathrm{cm}$
Most points are reasonably close to the line, so the correlation is fairly strong. This means that the line of best fit will allow a good level of accuracy when estimates are made.
TIP
If you are asked to comment on a prediction that you have made, always keep in mind the strength of the correlation as shown in the diagram. If the correlation is weak you should say that your prediction may not be very reliable.

Marbles in a box
Consider an imaginary three-dimensional game where two players take it in turn to place different coloured marbles into a box.
The box is made from 27 transparent unit cubes arranged in a 3-by-3-by-3 array.
![image](images/8a34944ed11f1d96971f832093358183165691e38d7e55c57782260aca88a0f2.jpg)
The aim of the game is to make a winning row of three of your own marbles. Rows can be horizontal, vertical or diagonal.
This diagram shows the placement of one winning row. The marbles are on three levels and the row is diagonal.
![image](images/b90cb8bccd9425c7d9afac1948f0d16e584a3dfaf82fbe02caede20c43350e8c.jpg)
How many different ways are there to make a winning row?
Explain clearly how you got to your answer.
TIP
Take note that in this diagram the edges of the cubes are not shown, just the placement of the marbles on each level.

**题目**: WORKED EXAMPLE 3
Josh's hourly rate of pay is \(12.50. He is paid 'time-and-a-half' for work after hours and on Saturdays and 'double-time' for Sundays and Public Holidays.
One week he worked 5.5 hours on Saturday and 3 hours on Sunday. How much overtime pay would he earn?

**解答**: Answer
Saturday overtime = 1.5 × $12.50 × 5.5 (time-and-a-half = 1.5 × normal
= $103.13 time)
Saturday overtime  $= 2 \times \$ 12.50 \times 3\) (double-time  $= 2 \times$  normal time)  
 $= \\(75$
Total overtime = $103.13 + $75.00
= $178.13

**题目**: WORKED EXAMPLE 4
Mr Smit's taxable income is \(153772.00 per annum. How much tax must he pay:
a per year? b per month?

**解答**: Answers
a To work out the yearly tax, find his tax bracket on the table. His income is in row two because it is between $132001 and $210000. He has to pay $23760 + 25% of his earnings above $132000.
$$
\begin{array}{l} \$ 153772 - \$ 132000 = \$ 21772 \\ 25 \% \text{of}\\ 21772 = \\ 5443 \\ \end{array}
$$
Tax payable =  $23760 +$ 5443 = $29203 per year
b $29203 ÷ 12 = $2433.58 To find the monthly tax, divide the total from part (a) by 12.

## 17 Managing money > 17.2 Borrowing and investing money

### WORKED EXAMPLE 5 (例题)

**题目**: WORKED EXAMPLE 5
$500 is invested at 10% per annum simple interest. How much interest is earned in three years?

**解答**: Answer
$$
10 \% \text{of}\$ 500 = \frac {10}{100}\times 500 = \$ 50 \quad \text{The interest rate is} 10 \% \text{per annum.}
$$
The interest every year is $50.
So after three years, the interest is:
$$
3 \times \$ 50 = \$ 150 \quad \text {M u l t i p l y b y t h e n u m b e r o f y e a r s}.

$$
\begin{array}{l} I = \frac {P R T}{1 0 0} \text {a n d} P = 4 0 0, \text {s o :} \\ P + I = 4 0 0 + \frac {(4 0 0 \times 1 5 \times 3)}{1 0 0} \\ = 1 0 0 + 1 8 0 \\ = \$ 580 \\ \end{array}

### WORKED EXAMPLE 7 (例题)

**题目**: WORKED EXAMPLE 7
How long will it take for $250 invested at the rate of 8% per annum simple interest to grow to $310?

**解答**: Answer
Amount = principal + interest
Interest = amount - principal
∴Interest = $310 - $250 = $60
Rate = 8% per annum =  $\frac{8}{100} \times 250 = \$ 20$
So the interest per year is $20.
Total interest  $(60)\div$  annual interest  $(20) = 3$
So it will take three years for  $250 to grow to$ 310 at the rate of 8% per annum simple interest.

---

### WORKED EXAMPLE 8 (例题)

**题目**: WORKED EXAMPLE 8
Calculate the rate of simple interest if a principal of  $250 grows to$ 400 in three years.

**解答**: Answer
Interest paid = $400 - $250 = $150
$$
I = \frac {P R T}{1 0 0}
$$
Change the subject of the formula to  $R$  to find the rate.
$$
1 0 0 I = P R T
$$
$$
R = \frac {1 0 0 I}{P T} = \frac {1 0 0 \times 1 5 0}{2 5 0 \times 3} = 2 0
$$
So, the interest rate = 20%

$$
\begin{array}{l} = \$ 6000 + \$ 16800 \\ = \$ 22 8 0 0 \\ \end{array}

### WORKED EXAMPLE 10 (例题)

**题目**: WORKED EXAMPLE 10
A person bought a car for $30000 on hire purchase. The deposit was 20% and interest on the outstanding balance for the period of repayment is at 10% per annum. If the balance is to be paid in 12 equal instalments, calculate each instalment.

**解答**: Answer
Cash price = $30000
Deposit of  $20\% = \frac{20}{100} \times 30000 = \$  6000$
Outstanding balance = $30000 - $6000 = $24000
Interest of  $10\% = \frac{10}{100} \times 24000 = \$  2400$
Amount to be paid by instalments = outstanding balance + interest
$$
\begin{array}{l} = \$ 24000 + \$ 2400 \\ = \$ 26 4 0 0 \\ \end{array}
$$
Each instalment = 26400/12 = $2200 (divide by total number of instalments)

### WORKED EXAMPLE 11 (例题)

**题目**: WORKED EXAMPLE 11
Priya invested $100 at a rate of 10%, compounded annually. How much is the investment worth after three years?

**解答**: Answer
Year 1
$$
I = \frac {P R T}{1 0 0} = \frac {1 0 0 \times 1 0 \times 1}{1 0 0} = \$ 1 0
$$
Use the formula for simple interest.
$$
P + I = \$ 100 + \$ 10 = \$ 110
$$
Year 2
$$
I = \frac {P R T}{1 0 0} = \frac {1 1 0 \times 1 0 \times 1}{1 0 0} = \$ 1 1
$$
P for year 2 is $110; T is one year as you are only finding the interest for year 2.
$$
P + I = 1 1 0 + 1 1 = \$ 1 2 1. 0 0
$$
Year 3
$$
I = \frac {P R T}{1 0 0} = \frac {1 2 1 \times 1 0 \times 1}{1 0 0} = \$ 1 2. 1 0
$$
P for year 3 is $121; T remains one year.

## 17 Managing money > 17.3 Buying and selling

### WORKED EXAMPLE 18 (例题)

**题目**: WORKED EXAMPLE 18
At a market, a trader makes a profit of  $1.08 on an item selling for$ 6.48.
What is his percentage profit?

**解答**: Answer
Cost price = $6.48 - $1.08 = $5.40
Subtract the profit from the selling price to find the cost price of the item.
profit Percentage profit  $=$  cost price  $\times 100$
$$
\begin{array}{l} = \frac {1 . 0 8}{5 . 4 0} \times 1 0 0 \\ = 20\% \\ \end{array}
$$

---

### WORKED EXAMPLE 19 (例题)

**题目**: WORKED EXAMPLE 19
Find the selling price of an article bought for $400 and sold at a loss of 10%.

**解答**: Answer
Cost price = $400
$$
\begin{array}{l} \text{Loss} = 10\% \text{of}\\ \\ \$ 400 \\ = \frac {1 0}{1 0 0} \times 4 0 0 \\ = \$ 40 \\ \end{array}
$$
Selling price  $=$  cost price - loss
$$
\begin{array}{l} = \$ 400 - \$ 40 \\ = \$ 360 \\ \end{array}
$$

---

### WORKED EXAMPLE 20 (例题)

**题目**: WORKED EXAMPLE 20
A trader sells her product for $39. If her mark up is 30%, what is the cost price of the product?

**解答**: Answer
Cost price + mark up = selling price
Selling price  $= 130\%$  of the cost price
So, \( \\( {39} = {130}\%  \times \) selling price
To find  $100\%$
$$
\frac {3 9}{1 3 0} \times 1 0 0 = \$ 3 0
$$
The cost price is $30.
Divide by 130 to find  $1\%$  and then multiply by 100 to find  $100\%$  (which is the cost price).

## 17 Managing money > 17.3 Buying and selling > Exercise 17.9

### WORKED EXAMPLE 21 (例题)

**题目**: WORKED EXAMPLE 21
During a sale, a shop offers a discount of  $15\%$  on a pair of jeans originally priced at $75. What is the sale price?

**解答**: Answer
Discount = 15% of $75
$$
\begin{array}{l} = \frac {1 5}{1 0 0} \times 7 5 \\ = \$ 11.25 \\ \end{array}
$$
Sale price = original price - discount
$$
\begin{array}{l} = \$ 75 - 1 1. 2 5 \\ = \$ 63.75 \\ \end{array}
$$
You can also work out the price by considering the sale price as a percentage of  $100\%$ .
100 - 15 = 85, so the sale price is 85% of $75:
$$
\frac {8 5}{1 0 0} \times 7 5 = \$ 6 3. 7 5
$$

There is no constant, c, so the y-intercept is 0 and the graph goes through the origin.
When  $y = 0, x = 0$ , so there is only one solution for  $x$  and you need to find a point on the graph.
Using  $x = 1$  substitute into the equation:  $y = 2(1)^2 = 2$  So (1, 2) is a point on the graph.
Sketch and label the graph.

**解答**: The coefficient of  $x$  is  $-1$  so the graph is  $\cap$  shaped.
The constant, c is 4, so the y-intercept is (0, 4).
When  $y = 0$
$$
\begin{array}{l} - x ^ {2} + 4 = 0 \\ \Rightarrow x ^ {2} - 4 = 0 \\ \Rightarrow x ^ {2} = 4 \\ \Rightarrow x = \pm \sqrt {4} \\ \end{array}
$$
$$
\text {S o} x = - 2 \text {o r} 2
$$
The x-intercepts are  $(-2,0)$  and  $(2,0)$

### WORKED EXAMPLE 5 (例题)

**题目**: WORKED EXAMPLE 5
Sketch the graph of  $y = x^{2} + 2x - 3$ .
Answer

![图片](../images/3426a9d9db41afce38c71de67ccf0b7a1bf06de17ac9bcc89f677b4a7c07ebcb.jpg)

**解答**: $x^{2}$  is positive, so the graph is U shaped.
y-intercept  $= (0, - 3)$  Remember that there is only ever one y-intercept.
To find the  $x$ -intercepts make  $y = 0$ , so
$$
x ^ {2} + 2 x - 3 = 0
$$
$$
(x + 3) (x - 1) = 0
$$
$$
x = - 3 \text {o r} x = 1
$$
So,  $(-3,0)$  and  $(1,0)$  are the  $x$ -intercepts.
The axis of symmetry is  $x = -\frac{b}{2a} = -\frac{2}{2(1)} = -1$ .
Substitute  $x = -1$  to find the turning point:  $(-1, -4)$ .

Answer

**解答**: $a = -2$  so the graph is  $\cap$  shaped.
The  $y$  -intercept  $= (0,6)$
Find the x-intercepts:
$$
\begin{array}{l} - 2 x ^ {2} - 4 x + 6 = 0 \\ x ^ {2} + 2 x - 3 = 0 \\ (x - 1) (x + 3) = 0 \\ x = 1 \text {o r} x = - 3 \\ \end{array}
$$
(1, 0) and  $(-3, 0)$  are the  $x$ -intercepts.
Find the axis of symmetry using  $x = -\frac{b}{2a}$ $x = \frac{4}{2(-2)} = -1$
Substitute  $x = -1$  into the equation to find the  $y$ -coordinate of the turning point.
$$
y = - 2 (- 1) ^ {2} - 4 (- 1) + 6 = 8
$$
The turning point is at  $(-1, 8)$  and is a maximum because a is negative.
Sketch the graph and label all the important features.

### WORKED EXAMPLE 7 (例题)

**题目**: WORKED EXAMPLE 7
a Determine the equation of the axis of symmetry and the turning point of  $y = x^2 - 8x + 13$  by completing the square.
b Sketch the graph.
Answers

**解答**: a  $y = x^{2} - 8x + 13$
First complete the square.
$$
y = (x - 4) ^ {2} - 1 6 + 1 3
$$
Half of 8 is four, but
$(x - 4)^2 = x^2 - 8x + 16$  so you have to subtract 16 to keep the equation balanced.
$$
y = (x - 4) ^ {2} - 3
$$
Simplify your solution.
Turning point: (4, -3)
Axis of symmetry:  $x = 4$
b To sketch the graph, you must find the intercepts.
y-intercept = (0,13)
You can read this from the original equation.
To find the  $x$ -intercept(s), let  $y = 0$  and solve.
$$
\begin{array}{l} 0 = (x - 4) ^ {2} - 3 \\ 3 = (x - 4) ^ {2} \\ x - 4 = \pm \sqrt {3} \\ x = \pm \sqrt {3} + 4 \\ x = 5. 7 \text {o r} 2. 3 \\ \end{array}

**解答**: Answer
$$

$$
You do not need all 24 points to draw the graph, so work out every second value.

TIP
Reciprocal equations have a constant product. If  $y = \frac{6}{x}$  then  $xy = 6$ . There is no value of  $y$  that corresponds with  $x = 0$  because division by 0 is meaningless. Similarly, if  $x$  was 0, then  $xy$  would also be 0 for all values of  $y$  and not 6, as it should be in this example. This is what causes the two parts of the curve to be disconnected.

**解答**: Answers
a Since this is the graph of  $y = x^{2} - 2x - 7$  simply find the points on the curve that have a  $y$ -coordinate of 0 (i.e. where the curve cuts the  $x$ -axis).
There are two such points marked A and B on the graph.
The  $x$ -coordinates of these points are -1.8 and 3.8, so the solutions of the equation  $x^{2} - 2x - 7 = 0$  are  $x = -1.8$  and  $x = 3.8$ .
b Find the points on the curve that have a  $y$ -coordinate of 3. (Draw in the horizontal line  $y = 3$  to help with this.)
There are two such points, marked  $P$  and  $Q$ , on the graph.
The  $x$ -coordinates of these points are -2.3 and 4.3, so the solutions of the equation  $x^2 - 2x - 7 = 3$  are  $x = -2.3$  and  $x = 4.3$ .
c Rearrange the equation  $x^{2} - 2x = 1$  so that the left-hand side matches the equation of the graph you are using.
Subtracting 7 from both sides gives  $x^{2} - 2x - 7 = 1 - 7$ , that is,  $x^{2} - 2x - 7 = -6$ .
You can now proceed as you did in parts (a) and (b).
Find the points on the curve that have a  $y$ -coordinate of  $-6$ ; they are marked  $S$  and  $T$  on the graph.
The  $x$ -coordinates of these points are -0.4 and 2.4.
The solutions of the equation  $x^{2} - 2x = 1$  are  $x = -0.4$  and  $x = 2.4$

### WORKED EXAMPLE 27 (例题)

**题目**: WORKED EXAMPLE 27
Find the equation of the tangent to the curve with equation  $y = 3x^2 - 4x + 1$  at the point with  $x$ -coordinate 2.

**解答**: Answer
$$
\begin{array}{l} \text {I f} x = 2 \text {t h e n :} \\ y = 3 (2) ^ {2} - 4 (2) + 1 \\ = 1 2 - 8 + 1 \\ = 5 \\ \end{array}
$$
Substitute  $x = 2$  into
the equation to find the y-coordinate.
So the tangent passes through the point (2, 5).
$$
\frac {d y}{d x} = 6 x - 4
$$
So the gradient  $= 6(2) - 4 = 8$
The equation will be of the form  $y = 8x + c$ .
Find the gradient of the tangent by differentiation.
Substitute  $x = 2$
You need to find the equation of a line with gradient 8, passing through the point with coordinates (2, 5).
$$
\text {W h e n} x = 2, y = 5, \text {s o}
$$
$$
\begin{array}{l} 5 = 8 \times 2 + c \\ \Rightarrow c = - 1 1 \\ \end{array}
$$
Substitute values for  $x$  and  $y$  and solve for  $c$
So the equation of the tangent is  $y = 8x - 11$ .

## 19 Symmetry > 19.3 Symmetry properties of circles

### 1 (例题)

**题目**: WORKED EXAMPLE 1
Chord AB is drawn in a circle with a radius of  $7\mathrm{cm}$  If the chord is  $3\mathrm{cm}$  from the centre of the circle, find the length of the chord correct to 2 decimal places.

![图片](../images/cbdff553dfcf37f76fd63754125a274ca73f6d9bd12c0e1b930caa823c4cf79f.jpg)

**解答**: Answer
$PB^{2} = OB^{2} - OP^{2}$  (Rearrange Pythagoras' theorem)
$$
\begin{array}{l} = 7 ^ {2} - 3 ^ {2} \\ = 4 9 - 9 \\ = 4 0 \\ \end{array}
$$
$$
\therefore P B = \sqrt {4 0}
$$
$$
\text {C h o r d} A B = 2 \times \sqrt {4 0} = 1 2. 6 5 \mathrm {c m}

### 2 (例题)

**题目**: WORKED EXAMPLE 2
O is the centre of the circle, radius 11 cm.
AB and CD are chords,  $AB = 14\mathrm{cm}$
If  $OX = OY$  find the length of OY correct to 2 decimal places.

![图片](../images/6e58d8642496768ee6d4e8c7eda788a686ec5508224ddb34d53fc3482814f200.jpg)

**解答**: Answer
Since  $OX = OY$  , chords are equidistant so,  $AB = CD = 14cm$
$CY = YD = 7$  cm (OY is the perpendicular bisector of CD)
$$
\text {A n g l e} O Y D = 9 0 ^ {\circ}
$$
$$
\begin{array}{l} O Y ^ {2} = O D ^ {2} - Y D ^ {2} (\text {P y t h a g o r a s}) \\ = 1 1 ^ {2} - 7 ^ {2} \\ = 1 2 1 - 4 9 \\ = 7 2 \\ \end{array}
$$
$$
\therefore O Y = \sqrt {7 2} = 8. 4 9 \mathrm {c m}
$$

**解答**: Answer
$$
\begin{array}{l} N M = P M = 2 5 \mathrm {c m} (\text {e q u a l t a n g e n t s}) \\ \therefore x = 2 5 \mathrm {c m} \\ \end{array}
$$
$$
\begin{array}{l} y ^ {2} = x ^ {2} + N O ^ {2} \quad \text {(P y t h a g o r a s)} \\ = 2 5 ^ {2} + 1 2 ^ {2} \\ = 6 2 5 + 1 4 4 \\ = 7 6 9 \\ \end{array}

**解答**: Answer
Angle  $OCB = 90^{\circ}$  (OC perpendicular to tangent CB)
$$
\begin{array}{l} \therefore y = 1 8 0 ^ {\circ} - 9 0 ^ {\circ} - 3 0 ^ {\circ} \text {a n g l e} \\ y = 6 0 ^ {\circ} \\ \end{array}
$$
$$
y = x = 6 0 ^ {\circ} (\text {t a n g e n t s}

## 19 Symmetry > 19.4 Angle relationships in circles

### 19.4 (例题)

**题目**: WORKED EXAMPLE 5
AB is the diameter of a circle. C is the centre. D is any point on the circumference. Remember that all radii of a circle are equal. Work out the size of angle ADB.
![image](images/6856aae4a9f04dc6bd9c4e66480bc00bb26f9b78fc020dfc20228ef8b5239a8b.jpg)

**解答**: Answer
$AC = CB = CD$  (radii of circle)   
: triangle ACD and triangle BCD are isosceles.   
: angle CAD = angle ADC = x   
and angle CDB = angle DBC = y   
But  $2x + 2y = 180^{\circ}$  (sum of angles in triangle ABD)   
:  $x + y + 90^{\circ}$    
so angle ADB = 90°

**解答**: Answer
Angles in a triangle add to  $180^{\circ}$
$$
\therefore A B C + B A C + 4 0 ^ {\circ} = 1 8 0 ^ {\circ}
$$
Both AC and BC are tangents to the circle so triangle ABC is isosceles.
$$
A B C + B A C + 4 0 ^ {\circ} = 1 8 0 ^ {\circ}
$$
$$
\therefore A B C = B A C = 7 0 ^ {\circ}
$$
By the alternate segment theorem, angle  $ABC =$  angle  $ADB = 70^{\circ}$ .
$$
S _ {0} x = 7 0 ^ {\circ}

**解答**: c The median is the middle value. You can find the middle value by dividing the total frequency by 2:
$$
\frac {3 0 0}{2} = 1 5 0, \text {s o t h e m e d i a n m a r k i s t h e 1 5 0 t h r e s u l t}.
$$
Draw a line from the 150th student (on the vertical axis) parallel to the marks (horizontal) axis. Drop a perpendicular from where this line cuts the graph. Read the value from the horizontal axis.
The median mark is 58.

**解答**: Answers
a You will need the midpoints of the classes to find an estimate of the mean, and you need the cumulative frequency to find an estimate of the median, so you must add more columns to the table. Don't forget to label the new columns.
[Table Row] <tr><td>Heights (hcm)</td><td>Midpoint (x)</td><td>Frequency (f)</td><td>Frequency × midpoint (fx)</td><td>Cumulative frequency</td></tr>
[Table Row] <tr><td>0 &lt; h ≤ 3</td><td>1.5</td><td>2</td><td>3</td><td>2</td></tr>
[Table Row] <tr><td>3 &lt; h ≤ 6</td><td>4.5</td><td>5</td><td>22.5</td><td>7</td></tr>
[Table Row] <tr><td>6 &lt; h ≤ 9</td><td>7.5</td><td>10</td><td>75</td><td>17</td></tr>
[Table Row] <tr><td>9 &lt; h ≤ 12</td><td>10.5</td><td>3</td><td>31.5</td><td>20</td></tr>
[Table Row] <tr><td>Total</td><td></td><td>Σf = 20</td><td>132</td><td></td></tr>
Estimated mean height  $= \frac{132}{20} = 6.6\mathrm{cm}$  (mean  $= \frac{\text{total} f x}{\text{total} f}$ )
![b](images/cb3185195cee2c53df02596c11a977ae618fc17c51ee29570229de3da0df9b4e.jpg)
$\frac{20}{2} = 10$  so the median height is the 10th value. Median height  $= 7.0\mathrm{cm}$

**解答**: Answer
80% of 200 is 160.
So, the value of P80 is a test score of 35. (Read off the graph where the curve is 160.)
Only those candidates who scored above 35 marks on the test will be invited for an interview.

**解答**: Answers
Method 1: multiplying by a common factor.
a  $1:4 = x:20$
$$
2 0 + 5 = 4, \text {s o} 2 0 = 4 \times 5
$$
1:4=5:20
1 must be multiplied by 5 as well.
![image](images/516a26e3065311c943a8b734a86ce4ae3b686636412c4cde99a10f6fb1af9e31.jpg)
Work out what 4 is multiplied by to get 20.
![image](images/23c8b1dc1f2eaa424ee21d23e4df10f1ca254a4995de02b6a9c549213f95b2a8.jpg)
$$
2 0 \div 5 = 4, \text {s o} 2 0 = 4 \times 5
$$
For an equivalent ratio, you must multiply 1 by 5 as well.
b  $4:9 = 24:y$
$$
2 4 \div 4 = 6, \text {s o} 4 \times 6 = 2 4
$$
4:9=24:54
9 must be multiplied by 6 as well.
Method 2: cross multiplying fractions.
a  $\frac{1}{4} = \frac{x}{20}$
Write the ratios as fractions.
$$
x = 1 \times \frac {2 0}{4}
$$
Solve the equation by multiplying both sides by 20.
$$
x = 5
$$
4 24 b 9
Write each ratio as a fraction.
$$
\frac {9}{4} = \frac {y}{2 4}
$$
Take the reciprocal of the fractions (turn them upside down) to get  $y$  at the top and make the equation easier to solve.
$$
\frac {9 \times 2 4}{4} = y
$$
Solve the equation by multiplying both sides by 24.
$$
\frac {2 1 6}{4} = y
$$
$$
y = 5 4
$$

**解答**: Answers
Map length: real length = 1:12000
Substitute the real length and use  $x$  to represent the unknown map length.
So,  $x_m:480m = 1:12000$
$$
\frac {x}{4 8 0} = \frac {1}{1 2 0 0 0}

**解答**: Answers
a The particle was accelerating in the period 0 to 0.8 seconds (section OA) and in the period 2 to 3.5 seconds (section BC).
b The gradient is constant between 2 and 3.5 seconds so acceleration was also constant in that period. So, the acceleration 3 seconds after the start is:
$$
\frac {2 5 - 1 5 (m / s)}{3 . 5 - 2 (s)} = \frac {1 0}{1 . 5} = 6. 7 m / s ^ {2}
$$
c Distance travelled  $=$  area under graph

Since the acceleration and deceleration are both constant, the speed-time graph consists of straight lines.
The greatest speed is  $60\mathrm{km / h}$
b Average speed = total distance / total time
$$
\begin{array}{l} = \frac {2 \mathrm {k m}}{(4 \text {m i n u t e s})} \\ = \frac {2 \times 1 5}{6 0 (\text {m i n u t e s})} \\ = 3 0 k m / h \\ \end{array}
$$
Units of speed are more commonly m/s or km/h so the units need changing.
Multiply top and bottom by 15 to get 60 minutes  $(= 1$  hour) on the bottom.
Calculate to give answer in km/h.

**题目**: WORKED EXAMPLE 19
A person travelling at  $30\mathrm{km / h}$  takes 24 minutes to get home from work. How long will the journey take if they travel at  $36\mathrm{km / h}$ ?

**解答**: Answer
30km/h takes 24 minutes.
This is inverse proportion; as one value decreases the other increases.
So,  $1\mathrm{km / h}$  would take  $30\times 24$  minutes.
To get  $1\mathrm{km / h}$  you divide the speed by 30, so multiply the time by 30.
at 36km/h it will take 30x24 36
To get  $36\mathrm{km / h}$  you multiply the speed by 36, so divide the time by 36.
$= 20$  minutes.

a Write this relationship as an equation.
b Find the value of  $y$  when  $x = 5$

**解答**: Answers
a  $y\propto x^3$  , which means (as an equation)  $y = kx^{3}$
$$
\text {W h e n} x = 2, x ^ {3} = 2 ^ {3} = 8
$$
$$
\therefore 3 2 = 8 k

If is inversely proportional to  $d^2$  and when  $d = 3$ ,  $F = 12$ .
Find the value of  $F$  when  $d = 4$

**解答**: Answer
$F\propto \frac{1}{d^2}$  which means (as an equation)  $F = \frac{k}{d^2}$
When  $d = 3$  and  $F = 12, 12 = \frac{k}{3^2} = \frac{k}{9}$
$$
\begin{array}{l} \therefore k = 1 2 \times 9 = 1 0 8 \\ S _ {0}, F = \frac {1 0 8}{d ^ {2}} \\ \text {I f} d = 4, \text {t h e n} F = \frac {1 0 8}{d ^ {2}} = \frac {1 0 8}{4 ^ {2}} = 6. 7 5 \\ \end{array}

[Table Row] <tr><td>q</td><td>2</td><td>5</td><td>8</td><td>12</td></tr>

**解答**: Answer
Compare each pair in turn:
$$
\frac {2 . 8}{2} = 1. 4 \quad \frac {7}{5} = 1. 4 \quad \frac {1 1 . 2}{8} = 1. 4 \quad \frac {1 6 . 8}{1 2} = 1. 4
$$
All the values are the same.
So, the values are directly proportional,  $p = 1.4q$ .

### WORKED EXAMPLE 25 (例题)

**题目**: WORKED EXAMPLE 25
The speed of water in a river is determined by a water-pressure gauge. The speed (vm/s) is directly proportional to the square root of the height (h cm) reached by the liquid in the gauge. Given that  $h = 36$  when  $v = 8$ , calculate the value of  $v$  when  $h = 18$ .

**解答**: Answer
$v \propto \sqrt{h}$  means that  $v = k\sqrt{h}$  where  $k$  is constant.
When  $y = 8$ ,  $h = 36$  and so  $8 = k\sqrt{36} = 6k$
It follows that  $k = \frac{4}{3}$  and the formula connecting  $v$  and  $h$  is  $v = \frac{4\sqrt{h}}{3}$ .
$$
\text {W h e n} h = 1 8, v = \frac {4 \sqrt {1 8}}{3} = 5. 6 6 (\text {t o} 3 \text {s . f .})

### WORKED EXAMPLE 3 (例题)

**题目**: The product of two consecutive integers is 42. Form and solve a quadratic equation to find both possible pairs of integers.

**解答**: Answer
Use the letter  $n$  to represent the smaller of the two numbers. Then the larger of the two numbers is  $n + 1$ .
The product of the two numbers is 42, so
$$
\begin{array}{l} n (n + 1) = 4 2 \\ \Rightarrow n ^ {2} + n = 4 2 \\ \Rightarrow n ^ {2} + n - 4 2 = 0 \\ \Rightarrow (n + 7) (n - 6) = 0 \\ \Rightarrow n = - 7 \text {o r} n = 6 \\ \end{array}
$$
$$
\text {I f} n = - 7, \text {t h e n} n + 1 = - 6.
$$
Check: -7 and -6 are consecutive integers and  $-6 \times -7 = 42$ .
$$
\text {I f} n = 6, \text {t h e n} n + 1 = 7.
$$
Check: 6 and 7 are consecutive integers and  $6 \times 7 = 42$ .
So the pairs of integers are 6, 7 and -7, -6.

![image](images/c77054437f47229412c8d8dec25f216b20cc2423871f07a1943518389589d59e.jpg)
Always draw a diagram to show the information and to help you visualise the situation.
The area is the length  $\times$  width, so
$$
\begin{array}{l} x (x + 2) = 1 5 \\ \Rightarrow x ^ {2} + 2 x = 1 5 \\ \Rightarrow x ^ {2} + 2 x - 1 5 = 0 \\ \Rightarrow (x + 5) (x - 3) = 0 \\ \Rightarrow x = - 5 \text {o r} x = 3 \\ \end{array}
$$
$x$  is the width of the rectangle,
so it cannot be a negative number.
This means  $x$  must be 3.

a  $y = \sqrt{2x - 1}$
Domain:  $y$  will not be a real number if  $(2x - 1)$  is negative.
$2x - 1\geq 0$  (must be positive)
WORKED EXAMPLE 14 CONTINUED

$$
$$
\text {D o m a i n :} \left\{x: x \geqslant \frac {1}{2} \right\}

### WORKED EXAMPLE 17 (例题)

**题目**: WORKED EXAMPLE 17
Find the inverse of  $f(x) = 3x - 4$ .

**解答**: Answer
Using method 1, the flow diagram, you get:  $f \colon$  input  $\rightarrow \boxed{\times 3} \rightarrow \boxed{-4} \rightarrow$  output
Reversing the diagram gives:  $f^{-1}$ : output  $\leftarrow \boxed{+3} \leftarrow \boxed{+4} \leftarrow \text{input}$
Let  $x$  be the input to  $f^{-1}:\frac{x + 4}{3}\gets \boxed{+3}\gets \boxed{+4}\gets x$
$$
S _ {0}, f ^ {- 1} (x) = \frac {x + 4}{3}

**解答**: Answer
Using method 1, the flow diagram, you get:  $g \colon \text{input} \to \boxed{\times(-2)} \to \boxed{+5} \to \text{output}$
Reversing the diagram gives:  $g^{-1}$ : output  $\leftarrow \boxed{+(-2)} \leftarrow \boxed{-5} \leftarrow \text{input}$
Let  $x$  be the input to  $g^{-1}:\frac{x - 5}{-2}\gets \boxed{+(-2)}\gets \boxed{-5}\gets x$

### WORKED EXAMPLE 19 (例题)

**题目**: WORKED EXAMPLE 19
Find the inverse of the function  $f(x) = 3x - 4$ .

**解答**: Answer
Using method 2, reversing the mapping.
$$
y = 3 x - 4
$$
Suppose the function maps  $x$  onto  $y$  (  $y$  is the subject).
$$
y + 4 = 3 x
$$
Make  $x$  the subject of the formula, so that  $y$  maps onto  $x$ .
$$
x = \frac {y + 4}{3}
$$
You know that  $f^{-1}$  maps  $y$  onto  $x$ , so  $f^{-1}(y) = \frac{y + 4}{3}$ .
This is usually written in terms of  $x$  so,  $f^{-1}(x) = \frac{x + 4}{3}$

### WORKED EXAMPLE 20 (例题)

**题目**: WORKED EXAMPLE 20
Given  $g(x) = 5 - 2x$ , find  $g^{-1}(x)$ .

**解答**: Answer
Let  $y = 5 - 2x$  This means g maps x onto y.
$2x = 5 - y$  Make  $x$  the subject of the formula, so that  $y$  maps onto  $x$
$$
x = \frac {5 - y}{2}
$$
g-1 maps y onto x, so g-1(y) =  $\frac{5 - y}{2}$
This is usually written in terms of  $x$  so,  $g^{-1}(x) = \frac{5 - x}{2}$

**解答**: Answer
A scale factor of  $\frac{1}{3}$  means the image will be smaller than the object.
Determine the coordinates of each vertex on the image. You can do this by multiplying the  $(x, y)$  coordinates of the vertices on the object by  $\frac{1}{3}$ .
$$
A = (1 2, 1 5), \text {s o} A ^ {\prime} = (4, 5)
$$
$$
B = (9, 6), \text {s o} B ^ {\prime} = (3, 2)
$$
$$
C = (1 8, 6), \text {s o} C ^ {\prime} = (6, 2)
$$
$$
D = (2 1, 9), \text {s o} D ^ {\prime} = (7, 3)
$$
Plot the point and draw and label the enlargement.

**解答**: Answers
OM=OB+BM
$$
\overrightarrow {O B} = b
$$
M is the midpoint of BC, so  $\overrightarrow{BM} = \frac{1}{2}\overrightarrow{BC} = \frac{1}{2} a$
$$
\therefore \overrightarrow {O M} = b + \frac {1}{2} a
$$
$$
\begin{array}{l} i i \quad \overrightarrow {M N} = \overrightarrow {M C} + \overrightarrow {C N} = \frac {1}{2} \overrightarrow {B C} + \frac {1}{2} \overrightarrow {C A} \\ \frac {1}{2} \overrightarrow {B C} = \frac {1}{2} a \text {a n d} \frac {1}{2} \overrightarrow {C A} = - \frac {1}{2} \overrightarrow {A C} = - \frac {1}{2} \overrightarrow {O B} = - \frac {1}{2} b \\ S _ {0}, \frac {1}{2} \overrightarrow {B C} + \frac {1}{2} \overrightarrow {C A} = \frac {1}{2} a - \frac {1}{2} b \\ = \frac {1}{2} (a - b) \\ \end{array}

b OM+MN = (b + 1/2a) + (1/2a - 1/2b)
$$
\begin{array}{l} = a + \frac {1}{2} b \\ \overrightarrow {O A} + \overrightarrow {A N} = a + \frac {1}{2} b \\ \therefore \overrightarrow {O M} + \overrightarrow {M N} = \overrightarrow {O A} + \overrightarrow {A N} \\ \end{array}

### WORKED EXAMPLE 20 (例题)

**题目**: WORKED EXAMPLE 20
Show that points  $P(2,4),Q(8,6)$  and  $R(11,7)$  are collinear.

**解答**: $$
\begin{array}{l} \overrightarrow {P Q} = q - p \quad \overrightarrow {Q R} = r - q \\ = \binom {8} {6} - \binom {2} {4} = \binom {6} {2} \quad = \binom {1 1} {7} - \binom {8} {6} = \binom {3} {1} \\ \end{array}
$$
But  $\binom{6}{2}=2\binom{3}{1}$ , so  $\overrightarrow{PQ}=2\overrightarrow{QR}$  and  $\overrightarrow{PQ}$  is parallel to  $\overrightarrow{QR}$ .
Point  $Q$  is common to  $\overrightarrow{PQ}$  and  $\overrightarrow{QR}$ , so  $P, Q$  and  $R$  are collinear.

Draw AB as the hypotenuse of a right-angled triangle.
$$
A B ^ {2} = 3 ^ {2} + 4 ^ {2}
$$
(Pythagoras' theorem)
$$
A B ^ {2} = 9 + 1 6
$$
$$
A B ^ {2} = 2 5
$$
$$
A B = 5
$$
$$
\therefore | \overrightarrow {A B} | = 5 \text {u n i t s}

**解答**: Answer
$$
\overrightarrow {O A} = \binom {3} {2} \text {a n d} \overrightarrow {O B} = \binom {- 2} {4}
$$
$$
\begin{array}{l} \overrightarrow {A B} = \overrightarrow {A O} + \overrightarrow {O B} = - \overrightarrow {O A} + \overrightarrow {O B} = \overrightarrow {O B} - \overrightarrow {O A} \\ = \binom {- 2} {4} - \binom {3} {2} = \binom {- 5} {2} \\ \end{array}
$$
$$
\mathrm {S o}, 2 \overrightarrow {A B} = 2 \binom {- 5} {2} = \binom {- 1 0} {4}.
$$
Alternative method:
You could also find the column vector for  $\overrightarrow{AB}$  by counting the movements parallel to the  $x$ -axis followed by those parallel to the  $y$ -axis.
Movement parallel to  $x$ -axis  $= -5$  units. Movement parallel to the  $y$ -axis  $= 2$  units.
$$
\overrightarrow {A B} = \left( \begin{array}{c} - 5 \\ 2 \end{array} \right)
$$

**解答**: a P(at least one female) = 7(1/2 × 1/2 × 1/2)
$$
\begin{array}{l} = 7 \times \frac {1}{8} \\ = \frac {7}{8} \\ \end{array}
$$
b P(two are female) = 3/8
c  $P(\text{first and last same sex}) = \frac{4}{8} = \frac{1}{2}$
All outcomes except MMM have at least one female.
This makes seven outcomes. As each outcome is
$\frac{1}{2} \times \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{1}{2}$  you can simply multiply this by 7.
There are three out of eight outcomes where there are two females.
FFF, FMF, MFM and MMM have the first and last with the same sex. The probability for each combination is  $\frac{1}{8}$ , so you can add the favourable combinations to give  $\frac{4}{8}$ .

In a survey, 25 people were asked to say if they liked fruit and if they liked vegetables.
15 people said they liked vegetables and 18 said they liked fruit.
Assuming that everyone surveyed liked fruit or vegetables or both, draw a Venn diagram and use it to work out the probability that a person chosen at random from this group will like:

b either fruit or vegetables

**解答**: Start by defining the sets and writing the information in set language. Use letters to make it quicker and easier to refer to the sets.
$$
\mathcal {E} = \{\text {n u m b e r o f p e o l e s u r v e y e d} \}, n (\mathcal {E}) = 2 5
$$
$$
F = \{\text {p e o p l e w h o l i k e f r u i t} \}, \text {s o} n (F) = 1 8
$$
$$
V = \{\text {p e o p l e w h o l i k e v e g e t a b l e s} \}, \text {s o} n (V) = 1 5
$$
$$
n (F) + n (V) = 1 8 + 1 5 = 3 3
$$
But the total number of people surveyed was only 25.
$33 - 25 = 8$  so 8 people must have said they liked both fruit and vegetables.
$$
n (F \cap V) = 8
$$
Once you've defined the sets, you can draw the diagram.
You don't know the names of the people surveyed, so you have to work with the number of people in each set.

This is an example of conditional probability. You cannot choose the same ball twice, so for the second set of branches there are only 20 balls left. If the first ball is blue, there are only 11 blue balls left but still 9 green balls. If the first ball is green, there are only 8 green balls left, but still 12 blue. In each case the numerator of one branch has changed but the numerators still add up to the value of the denominator (as this has also changed).
12 11 11 b i 21 20 35
9 8 6 ii P(GG) 21 20 35
12 9 12 18 35

**解答**: Answers
Start by identifying the sets and drawing a Venn diagram.
$T =$  {students who work on tablets}  $n(T) = 36$
$L =$  {students who work on laptops}  $n(L) = 20$
$50 - 12 = 38$  so there are 38 students in  $T$  and  $L$  combined.
$36 + 20 = 56$  , but there are only 38 students in  $T$  and L combined.
$56 - 38 = 18$  so 18 students work on both  $(T\cap L)$
![image](images/4f4de40801c65531aa791e7fc66a60feeae6a9f8c614517b9b6711fbe2c766dd.jpg)
a P works on both)  $= P(T\cap L) = \frac{18}{50} = \frac{9}{25}$
b  $P(\text{works on at least one}) = 1 - P(\text{works on neither}) = 1 - \frac{12}{50} = \frac{38}{50} = \frac{19}{25}$
c  $P(T$  given that  $L$  has happened)  $= \frac{P(L\text{and}T)}{P(L)} = \frac{n(L\cap T)}{n(L)}$
$$
= \frac {1 8}{2 0} = \frac {9}{1 0}
$$
d P(Not L given T has happened) = P(L' and T) = 18/36 = 1/2

[Table Row] <tr><td>Total</td><td>450</td><td>650</td><td>200</td><td></td></tr>
You know the student is in Grade 11, so you only need to look at the values for Grade 11.
P(Phone user given Grade 11) =  $\frac{250}{650} = \frac{5}{13}$
250 out of the 650 students in Grade 11 use a phone to access the internet.
b P(PC user given Grade 10) =  $\frac{120}{650} = \frac{12}{65}$
This time you need to look at the Grade 10 values.
c P(Grade 11 given they use a tablet) =  $\frac{320}{650} = \frac{32}{65}$
You know the student uses a tablet so use the values in the tablet column.
650 students use a tablet and 320 are in Grade 11.

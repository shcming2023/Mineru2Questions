You are a document structure analyst specializing in educational textbooks.

## Task
Analyze the FULL TEXT of an educational document and identify ALL structural chapter/section headings.
Each line is a text block: [ID|pageNumber|optionalTypeTag] text

## CRITICAL: Table of Contents vs. Document Body
The first few pages may contain a TABLE OF CONTENTS (listing chapter names with page numbers).
You MUST IGNORE the actual Table of Contents lists.
HOWEVER, do NOT ignore "Front Matter" sections (like Introduction, Preface) or "Unit" title pages that appear before the main chapters.

Table of contents signs (IGNORE these):
- Pages explicitly labeled "Contents" or "Table of Contents"
- Lists of titles followed by page numbers (e.g., "1.1 ... 5", "Chapter 2 ... 12")
- Dense lists of headings on a single page

## What ARE Structural Headings (INCLUDE)
- **Front Matter**: Introduction, Preface, How to use this book, Acknowledgements, etc.
- **Back Matter**: Glossary, Index, Answers, etc.
- **Organization Containers**: Units, Modules, Parts, Themes (e.g., "Unit 1", "Module A")
- **Chapters**: (e.g., "Chapter 1", "1 Review of number concepts")
- **Sections**: (e.g., "1.1 Different types of numbers")
- **Sub-sections**: (e.g., "1.1.1", "Case Study")
- **Assessments**: "Past paper questions", "Project", "Review", "Summary"

## What Are NOT Headings (MUST EXCLUDE)
- The actual Table of Contents list itself
- Instructional labels: "Key points", "Tip", "Note", "Activity", "Exercise", "Q&A"
- Problem type labels: "Question 1", "Section A", "Multiple Choice"
- Running headers/footers (often repeated at top/bottom of pages)

## Hierarchy (Map to logical levels)
        - **Level 1**: Top-level containers.
          - Front Matter / Back Matter categories (e.g., "Front Matter", "Back Matter")
          - Units / Parts / Modules / Themes (e.g., "Unit 1", "Part A")
          - Standalone Chapters if no Units exist
        - **Level 2**: Main content divisions.
          - Chapters (if inside a Unit)
          - Sections (if inside a standalone Chapter)
          - Specific Front/Back Matter sections (e.g., "Introduction", "Foreword", "Glossary")
        - **Level 3**: Sub-divisions.
          - Sections (if inside a Unit->Chapter)
          - Sub-sections
          - Specific items like "1.1 Understanding units"
        - **Level 4**: Deep sub-divisions (if needed).
          - Sub-sections (e.g., "1.1.1")

        ## Fragmented Titles
If a heading is split across consecutive blocks (e.g., block 100="Chapter" + block 101="1"), merge them: output id as [100, 101].

## Completeness
- Include EVERY structural heading from the very beginning (Introduction) to the very end (Index).
- Do not skip "Unit" pages.

## Output Format
Return ONLY valid JSON:
{
  "directory": [
    {"id": <number or [n1, n2]>, "level": <1|2|3>, "title": "<heading text>"},
    ...
  ]
}
Array MUST be in the LOGICAL order of the document.

## CRITICAL RULE: RETURN ORIGINAL IDs
The block IDs you see (e.g., [12479|p394|T1]) are GLOBAL IDs. You MUST return these exact IDs. DO NOT generate your own sequential IDs starting from 0.
- CORRECT: {"id": 12479, ...}
- WRONG: {"id": 0, ...} (when the block shown was [12479|...])

[12453|p393|T1] TIP
[12454|p393] The symbol [EQ] is the Greek letter capital 'sigma'. It is used to mean 'sum'. So, [EQ] simply means 'the sum of all the frequencies'.

[12479|p394|T1] 12.5 Quartiles
[12480|p394] Quartiles are used to divide a data set into four groups. Quartiles are indicated by the symbols [EQ] , [EQ] and [EQ] .
[12481|p394] You can use the following rules to estimate the positions of each quartile within a set of [EQ] items of ordered data:
[12482|p395] [Equation]
[12483|p395] If the position does not turn out to be a whole number, find the mean of the pair of numbers on either side. For example, if the position of the lower quartile turns out to be 5.25, then you find the ...
[12484|p395|T1] Interquartile range
[12485|p395] As with the range, the interquartile range gives a measure of how spread out or consistent the data is. The main difference is that the interquartile range (IQR) avoids using extreme data by finding t...
[12486|p395] [Equation]
[12487|p395] If one set of data has a smaller IQR than another set, then the first set is more consistent and less spread out. This can be a useful comparison tool.
[12488|p395|T1] WORKED EXAMPLE 5
[12489|p395] For each set of data calculate the median, upper quartile, lower quartile and the interquartile range.
[12490|p395] a 13 12 8 6 11 14 8 5 1 10 16 12
[12491|p395] b 14 10 8 19 15 14 9
[12492|p395|T1] Answer
[12493|p395] a First sort the data into ascending order:
[12494|p395] 1568810111212131416
[12495|p395] There are an even number of items (12). So, to find the median, find the mean of the middle pair. The first of the pair is in position [EQ] , so the median is [EQ] .
[12496|p395] Calculate the position of the quartiles:
[12497|p395] [Equation]
[12498|p395] These are not whole numbers, so the lower quartile is the mean of the 3rd and 4th values, and the upper quartile is the mean of the 9th and 10th values.
[12499|p395] [Equation]
[12500|p395] Then you know that the IQR = 12.5 - 7 = 5.5.
[12501|p395] b The ordered data is:
[12502|p395] 891014141519
[12503|p395] There is an odd number of data values, so the median is in position [EQ] . The median is 14.
[12504|p395|T1] MATHEMATICAL CONNECTIONS
[12505|p395] In Chapter 20 you will learn about cumulative frequency graphs. These allow you to calculate estimates for the median and quartiles when there are too many data points to put into order, or when you h...
[12506|p396|T1] WORKED EXAMPLE 5 CONTINUED
[12507|p396] There are seven items, so the positions of the quartiles are: [EQ] and [EQ] .
[12508|p396] These are whole numbers so the lower quartile is in position two and the upper quartile is in position six.
[12509|p396] So [EQ] and [EQ] .

[12513|p396|T1] Answer
[12514|p396] I would buy Barstows' seeds. Although Allbright sunflowers seem taller (with a higher median) they are less consistent. So, there is a chance of a very big sunflower, but there is also a good chance o...

[12625|p400|T1] SUMMARY
[12626|p400|T1] Do you know ...?
[12627|p400] Averages - the mode, median and mean - are used to summarise a collection of data.
[12628|p400] Discrete data can be listed or arranged in a frequency distribution.
[12629|p400] Continuous data can be listed or arranged into groups.
[12630|p400] The mean is affected by extreme data.
[12631|p400] The median is less affected by extreme data.
[12632|p400] The lower quartile [EQ] lies [EQ] of the way through the data.
[12633|p400] The upper quartile [EQ] lies [EQ] of the way through the data.
[12634|p400] The interquartile range [EQ] gives a measure of how spread out or consistent the central [EQ] of the data is.
[12635|p400] The range is the difference between the largest and smallest values and also measures spread, but it is affected by extreme values and is used less often than the interquartile range.

[13030|p417] The methods you have seen in the examples so far are best used when you are dealing with time within the same day. But what happens when the time difference goes from one day to another day?
[13031|p417|T1] WORKED EXAMPLE 4
[13032|p417] How much time passes from 19:35 on Monday to 03:55 on Tuesday?
[13033|p417|T1] Answer
[13034|p417] 19:35 to 24:00 is one part and 00:00 to 03:55 the next day is the other part.
[13035|p417] A good way to start this problem is to divide the time into parts.
[13036|p417|T1] Part one:
[13037|p417] 19:35 to 20:00 is 25 minutes 20:00 to 24:00 is 4 hours So, 19:35 to 24:00 is 4 h 25 min
[13038|p417] Work out how much time passes to reach midnight.
[13039|p417|T1] Part two:
[13040|p417] 0:00 to 03:55 is 3 h 55 min
[13041|p417] 03:55 is 3 hours and 55 minutes past midnight.
[13042|p417] 4h 25min + 3h 55min = 7h 80min = 8h 20min
[13043|p417] Add the result of the two parts together.
[13044|p417] The total time is 8 hours and 20 minutes.
[13045|p417] 80 minutes = 1 hour 20 minutes

[13132|p421] The smallest value a measurement can take is called the lower bound. The greatest value it can take is called the upper bound. The difference between the upper and lower bounds is called the error int...

[13143|p421|T1] Finding the greatest and least possible values of a rounded measurement
[13144|p421] In the crane example 1.2 tonnes is rounded to 1 decimal place. It can be useful to work out the greatest and least possible values of the actual measurement.
[13145|p421] If you place 1.2 on a number line, you can see much more clearly what the range of possible values are:
[13146|p421] [Image]
[13147|p421] At the upper end, the range of possible values stops at 1.25. If you round 1.25 to 1 decimal place you get 1.3. Although 1.25 does not round to 1.2 (to 1 decimal place).
[13148|p422] it is still used as the upper value. However, you should understand that the actual value can be anything up to but not including 1.25. The largest possible value is called the upper bound. Similarly,...

[13340|p429] You can use conversion graphs when you need to convert from one measurement to another, for example from miles (imperial) to kilometres (metric) or from dollars to yen.
[13341|p429] Eight kilometres is approximately equal to five miles.
[13342|p429] If you travel no distance in kilometres then you also travel no distance in miles.
[13343|p429] These two facts mean you can draw a graph for converting between miles and kilometres.
[13344|p429] If you extend the line far enough you can read higher values. Notice, for example, that the line passes through the point with coordinates (25, 40). This means that 25 miles is approximately 40 km.

[13579|p439] You studied equations of straight lines in Chapter 10 and you already know how to solve equations with one unknown.
[13580|p440] If you let [EQ] be the number of walks into the hills and [EQ] be the number of walks along the river, you can use the total number of walks to see that [EQ] .
[13581|p440] The total distance walking in the hills will be [EQ] and the total distance walking along the river will be [EQ] . So the total distance walked is [EQ] , which must equal 26.
[13582|p440] This gives two equations:

[13584|p440] [Equation]

[13586|p440] [Image]
[13587|p440] Notice that the point with coordinates (5, 3) lies on both lines so, [EQ] and [EQ] satisfy both equations. You can check this by substituting the values into the equations:
[13588|p440] [Equation]
[13589|p440] and

[13601|p441|T1] Answer
[13602|p441] [Image]
[13603|p441] For the first equation:
[13604|p441] [Equation]
[13605|p441] So this line passes through the points [EQ] and [EQ] .
[13606|p441] For the second equation:
[13607|p441] [Equation]
[13608|p441] [Equation]
[13609|p441] So this line passes through the points (0, 5) and [EQ] .
[13610|p441] Plot the pairs of points and draw lines through them.
[13611|p441] Notice that the two lines meet at the point with coordinates [EQ] .
[13612|p441] So, the solution to the pair of equations is [EQ] and [EQ] .

[13679|p443] Substitute [3] into [1] by replacing [EQ] with [EQ]
[13680|p443] Remove brackets.
[13681|p443] Add 48 to both sides.
[13682|p443] Add like terms.
[13683|p443] Divide both sides by 11.
[13684|p443] Now, substitute the value of [EQ] into any of the
[13685|p443] Equations to find [EQ] . Equation [3] will be easiest,
[13686|p443] so use this one.
[13687|p443] Write out the solutions.
[13688|p443|T1] MATHEMATICAL CONNECTIONS
[13689|p443] The substitution method involves rearranging formulae to make one of the variables the subject. You learnt how to do this in Chapter 6.
[13690|p443|T1] TIP
[13691|p443] You should always number the
[13692|p443] equations so you
[13693|p443] can identify each
[13694|p443] equation quickly
[13695|p443] and easily.
[13696|p444|T1] Solving by elimination
[13697|p444] You can also solve simultaneous equations by eliminating (getting rid of) one of the variables.

[13703|p444] [EQ] [1] You can add the two equations together by adding the [EQ] [2] left-hand sides and adding the right-hand sides.
[13704|p444] [Equation]
[13705|p444] [Equation]
[13706|p444] Notice that the equation that comes from this addition no longer contains a [EQ] term, so you can now solve to find the value of [EQ] .
[13707|p444] [EQ] [2] You now need to find the [EQ] -value that goes with this [EQ] value of [EQ] .Substitute [EQ] into equation [2].

[13709|p444] [EQ] Check that these values for [EQ] and [EQ] work in equation [1].
[13710|p444] Both equations are satisfied by the pair of values [EQ] and [EQ]
[13711|p444] The following worked examples look at different cases where you may need to subtract the equations, instead of adding, or where you need to multiply one or both equations before you add or subtract.

[14042|p454|T1] A warning
[14043|p454] Before working through the next exercise you must understand and apply one further rule. Think about this inequality:
[14044|p454] [Equation]
[14045|p454] If you divide both sides by [EQ] it appears that the solution will be,
[14046|p454] [Equation]
[14047|p454] This is satisfied by any value of [EQ] that is greater than -3, for example -2, -1, 2.4, 3.5, 10 ...
[14048|p454] If you calculate the value of [EQ] for each of these values you get 13, 8, -9, -14.5, -47 ... and not one of these works in the original inequality as they are all smaller than 18.
[14049|p454] Here is an alternative solution:
[14050|p454] [Equation]
[14051|p454] [Equation]
[14052|p454] [Equation]
[14053|p454] This is a correct solution, and the final answer is very similar to the 'wrong' one above.
[14054|p454] The only difference is that the inequality symbol has been reversed.
[14055|p455] Why does this happen? When you multiply both sides by a negative value, the side that was greater will end up being a 'bigger' negative number, which actually means it is now less than the other side!
[14056|p455] You need to remember the following:

[14132|p458|T1] Rules for boundaries and shading of regions
[14133|p458] You have already seen inequalities are not always [EQ] or [EQ] . They may also be [EQ] or [EQ] . Graphical representations have to show the difference between these variations.
[14134|p458] When the inequality includes equal to [EQ] or [EQ] ), the boundary line must be included in the graphical representation. It is therefore shown as a solid line.
[14135|p459] When the inequality does not include equal to [EQ] , the boundary line is not included in the graphical representation, so it is shown as a broken line.

[14372|p468|T1] TIP
[14373|p468] It is more accurate to leave your answer in surd form than to convert to a decimal. Surds are exact, but decimals are approximations.

[14376|p468|T1] TIP
[14377|p468] Notice that there are brackets around the -7. If you miss these the calculation becomes [EQ] rather than [EQ] .
[14378|p468] If [EQ] is negative always use brackets to make sure that you square it correctly.

[14447|p470] In general, if the coefficient of [EQ] in a quadratic is a number other than 1 you need to carry out more steps to factorise the expression.

[14455|p470] a [EQ]
[14456|p470] [Equation]
[14457|p470] The only way to produce the term [EQ] is to multiply [EQ] and [EQ] . Place these two terms at the front of each bracket. There are blank spaces in the brackets because you don't yet know what else nee...
[14458|p470] The constant term is 1, so the only possible values are +1 or -1. Since the constant term is positive, the unknown values must be either both -1 or both +1.
[14459|p470] Try each of these combinations systematically:
[14460|p470] [EQ]
[14461|p470] The coefficient of [EQ] is wrong.

[14463|p470] This is correct.

[14467|p471] b [EQ]
[14468|p471] Start by writing [EQ]
[14469|p471] The two unknown terms must multiply to give 8. Since the constant term is positive, the unknowns must have the same sign. The possible pairs are:
[14470|p471] 8 and 1 2 and 4 -8 and -1 -2 and -4
[14471|p471] Try each pair in turn, remembering that you can reverse the order:
[14472|p471] [Equation]
[14473|p471] [Equation]
[14474|p471] [Equation]
[14475|p471] This last one is very close. You just need to change the sign of the 'x' term. This can be done by jumping to the last pair: -2 and -4.

[14480|p471] [Equation]
[14481|p471] The two unknown terms must multiply to give [EQ] , because you have taken out the common factor 2. The possible pairs are:
[14482|p471] 2 and -3 3 and -2 6 and -1 -6 and 1
[14483|p471] Test the pairs until you find the correct combination.
[14484|p471] You will find that:
[14485|p471] [Equation]
[14486|p471] d [EQ]
[14487|p471] This question requires more thought because there is more than one way to multiply two expressions to get [EQ] :
[14488|p471] 2x and 5x or 10x and x.
[14489|p471] Each possibility needs to be tried.
[14490|p471] Start with [EQ]
[14491|p471] Factor pairs that multiply to give -8 are:
[14492|p471] -8 and 1 8 and -1 2 and -4 -2 and 4
[14493|p471] Remember that you will need to try each pair with the two values in either order.
[14494|p471] For this particular quadratic you will find that none of the eight possible combinations works!
[14495|p471] Instead, you must now try: [EQ] .
[14496|p471] Trying the above set of pairs once again you will eventually find that:

[14517|p472] Factorise [EQ]
[14518|p472|T1] Answer
[14519|p472] [EQ]
[14520|p472] Multiply the coefficient of [EQ] by the constant term.
[14521|p472] -1, 80 (no)
[14522|p472] List the factor pairs of -80 until you obtain a pair that totals the coefficient of [EQ] , which is 11.
[14523|p472] -2, 40 (no)
[14524|p472] (Note that as 11 is positive and -80 is negative, the larger number of the pair must be positive and the other negative.)
[14525|p472] [EQ]
[14526|p472] Rewrite the [EQ] term using this factor pair.

[14573|p473] The HCF of [EQ] and [EQ] is [EQ] . You can divide both the numerator and the denominator by this HCF.
[14574|p473] d [EQ]
[14575|p473] Notice that you can factorise both the numerator and the denominator.
[14576|p473] [Equation]
[14577|p473] [EQ] is a factor of both the numerator and the denominator, so you can cancel this common factor.

[14876|p486] What advice would you give to a student who finds this work difficult?
[14877|p487|T1] 15.2 Bearings
[14878|p487] You have now used scale drawings to find distances between objects and to measure angles. When you want to move from one position to another, you not only need to know how far you have to travel but y...
[14879|p487] The angle [EQ] , shown on the right, is measured clockwise from the north direction. Such an angle is called a bearing.
[14880|p487] All bearings are measured clockwise from the north direction.
[14881|p487] Here the bearing of [EQ] from [EQ] is [EQ]
[14882|p487|T1] MATHEMATICAL CONNECTIONS
[14883|p487] One degree of bearing does not seem like a lot but it can represent a huge distance in the real world. This is why you need to use the trigonometry you will learn later in this chapter to calculate an...
[14884|p487] If the angle is less than [EQ] you still use three figures so that it is clear that you mean to use a bearing.
[14885|p487] Here the bearing of [EQ] from [EQ] is [EQ]
[14886|p487] [Image]
[14887|p487] [Image]
[14888|p487] Since you always measure clockwise from north it is possible for your bearing to be a reflex angle.

[14897|p488] [Image]
[14898|p488|T1] Answer
[14899|p488] In the second diagram, the two north lines are parallel. Hence angle [EQ] (using the properties of corresponding angles).
[14900|p488] The bearing of city A from town [EQ]
[14901|p488] Notice that the difference between the two bearings [EQ] and [EQ] is [EQ]
[14902|p488|T1] TIP
[14903|p488] Always make sure that you draw a clear diagram and mark all north lines clearly. Bearings should always be measured from north.

[14971|p491] Lengths and angles in triangles
[14972|p491] You will now explore the relationship between the opposite, adjacent and hypotenuse and the angles in a right-angled triangle.
[14973|p491] For this investigation, draw four different scale copies of this diagram. Draw the angles as accurately as possible, and all four triangles should be different sizes.
[14974|p491] [Image]
[14975|p491] 1 Label opp(30°), adj(30°) and hypotenuse clearly.
[14976|p491] 2 Measure the length of opp(30°) and write it down.
[14977|p491] 3 Measure the length of adj(30°) and write it down.
[14978|p491] 4 Calculate [EQ] in each case.
[14979|p491] 5 What do you notice about your answers?
[14980|p491] 6 Compare your answers with those of a partner. What do you notice?
[14981|p491] 7 Now repeat the investigation using another right-angled triangle with different angles. Write down any observations that you make.
[14982|p491] 8 Does the same happen if you divide another pair of sides for each triangle?
[14983|p491|T1] Tangent ratio
[14984|p491] It turns out that [EQ] is constant for any given angle [EQ] . [EQ] depends on the angle only, and not the actual size of the triangle. The ratio [EQ] is called the tangent ratio and you write:

[14989|p491] Look back at the work on calculating gradients in Chapter 10 and compare it with the tangent ratio. What connection do you notice?
[14990|p492] Your calculator can work out the tangent ratio for any given angle and you can use this to help work out the lengths of unknown sides of a right-angled triangle.
[14991|p492] For example, if you wanted to find the tangent of the angle [EQ] you enter:
[14992|p492] [Image]
[14993|p492] Notice that the answer has many decimal places. When using this value you must make sure that you don't round your answers too soon.
[14994|p492] Now, consider the right-angled triangle shown.
[14995|p492] You can find the unknown side, [EQ] cm, by writing down what you know about the tangent ratio:

[15366|p506] Isosceles right-angled triangles contain one [EQ] angle and two [EQ] angles:

[15380|p507] You learnt about irrational numbers in Chapter 9. Surds such as [EQ] and recurring decimals such as [EQ] are irrational numbers and cannot be written exactly in decimal form.
[15381|p507] When a question asks for an answer in exact form, you need to leave surds in root form and recurring decimals as fractions.
[15382|p507] You can also use an equilateral triangle, with side [EQ] , to find exact trigonometric ratios for the sine, cosine and tangent of [EQ] and [EQ] .

[15387|p507] [Equation]
[15388|p507] If you think about the angle marked [EQ] instead, then [EQ] becomes the opposite, [EQ] becomes the adjacent and [EQ] remains the hypotenuse.

[15672|p521] For the triangle shown on the right, the following are true:
[15673|p521] [Equation]
[15674|p521] These relationships are usually expressed in one go:
[15675|p521] [Equation]
[15676|p521] This is the sine rule. This version of the rule, with the sine ratios placed on the tops of the fractions, is normally used to calculate angles.
[15677|p521] The formulae can also be turned upside down when you want to calculate lengths:
[15678|p521] [Equation]
[15679|p521] You should remember that this represents three possible relationships.
[15680|p521] Notice that in each case, both the upper and lower case form of each letter is used. This means that each fraction that you use requires an angle and the length of its opposite side.
[15681|p521|T1] TIP
[15682|p521] Remember, the sine rule is used when you are dealing with pairs of opposite sides and angles.

[15687|p522] [Image]
[15688|p522|T1] Answer
[15689|p522] To calculate the angle [EQ] , use the fact that the sum of the three angles in a triangle is always [EQ]
[15690|p522] [Equation]
[15691|p522] Now think about the side AB. AB is opposite the angle C (forming an 'opposite pair') and side BC is opposite angle A, forming a second 'opposite pair'.
[15692|p522] So, write down the version of the sine rule that uses these pairs:
[15693|p522] [Equation]
[15694|p522] Similarly:
[15695|p522] AC forms an opposite pair with angle B, so once again use the pair BC and angle A:
[15696|p522] [Equation]
[15697|p522|T1] The ambiguous case of the sine rule
[15698|p522] The special properties of the sine function can lead to more than one possible answer.
[15699|p522] Worked example 18 demonstrates how this may happen.
[15700|p522|T1] TIP
[15701|p522] The word 'ambiguous' means that there is more than one way to interpret the question being asked. Here the ambiguous case arises because there are two possible answers.

[15710|p523] Angle EDF is opposite a side of length [EQ] . This forms the second pair.
[15711|p523] You are trying to find an angle, so choose the version of the sine rule with the value of sine ratios in the numerators:
[15712|p523] [Equation]
[15713|p523] So, angle [EQ]
[15714|p523] But there is actually a second angle DEF such that [EQ] .
[15715|p523] You can see this if you consider the sine graph. The values of both [EQ] and [EQ] repeat every [EQ] . This property of both functions is called 'periodicity', i.e., both [EQ] and [EQ] are periodic. Th...
[15716|p523] Both of these are possible values of angle DEF because there are two ways to draw such a triangle.

[15855|p530] You already know that the area of a triangle is given by the following formula:
[15856|p530] This method can be used if you know both the length of the base and perpendicular height, but if you don't have these values you need to use another method.

[15916|p534] You can also use the trigonometry ratios to solve problems in three dimensions. With problems of this kind you must draw and label each triangle as you use it. This will help you to organise your thou...
[15917|p534] When you work with solids you may need to calculate the angle between an edge, or a diagonal, and one of the faces. This is called the angle between a line and a plane.
[15918|p534] Consider a line [EQ] , which meets a plane [EQ] at point [EQ] . Through [EQ] draw lines [EQ] in the plane and consider the angles [EQ]
[15919|p534] [Image]
[15920|p534] - If [EQ] is perpendicular to the plane, all these angles will be right angles.
[15921|p534] If [EQ] is not perpendicular to the plane, these angles will vary in size.
[15922|p534] It is the smallest of these angles which is called the angle between the line [EQ] and the plane [EQ] .
[15923|p534] To identify this angle, do the following:
[15924|p534] From [EQ] draw a perpendicular to the plane. Call the foot of this perpendicular [EQ] .
[15925|p534] The angle between the line [EQ] and the plane is angle [EQ]
[15926|p534] [Image]
[15927|p534] [EQ] is called the projection of [EQ] on the plane [EQ] .
[15928|p534] The following worked example shows how you might work through a problem in three dimensions.
[15929|p535|T1] WORKED EXAMPLE 25
[15930|p535] The diagram represents a room which has the shape of a cuboid. [EQ] , [EQ] and [EQ] . Calculate the angle between the diagonal [EQ] and the floor [EQ] .
[15931|p535] [Image]
[15932|p535|T1] Answer
[15933|p535] First identify the angle required. [EQ] is the point where the diagonal BS meets the plane ABCD.
[15934|p535] [EQ] is the perpendicular from [EQ] to the plane [EQ] and so [EQ] is the projection of [EQ] onto the plane.
[15935|p535] [Image]
[15936|p535] The angle required is SBD.
[15937|p535] You know that triangle SBD has a right angle at [EQ] and that [EQ] (equal to AP).
[15938|p535] To find angle SBD, you need to know the length of DB or the length of SB. You can find the length of BD by using Pythagoras' theorem in triangle ABD.
[15939|p535] [Image]
[15940|p535] [Equation]
[15941|p535] So, using right-angled triangle SBD:

[16125|p544] In the example of the ice cream shop, it seems sensible that the total sales will depend on the temperature, so plot the sales on the vertical axis.
[16126|p544|T1] TIP
[16127|p544] If you are told to plot A against B, then you should plot A on the vertical axis and B on the horizontal axis.
[16128|p545] [Image]

[16139|p546|T1] Drawing a line of best fit
[16140|p546] You can also show the general trend by drawing a line of best fit. In the diagram a line has been drawn so that it passes as close to as many points as possible.
[16141|p546] [Image]
[16142|p546] This is the line of best fit and you can use it to make predictions based on the collected data.
[16143|p546] For example, if you want to try to predict the ice cream sales on a day with a temperature of [EQ] , you carry out the following steps:
[16144|p546] 1. Locate [EQ] on the temperature axis.
[16145|p546] 2 Draw a clear line vertically from this point to the line of best fit.
[16146|p546] 3 Draw a horizontal line from the point on the line of best fit to the sales axis.
[16147|p546] 4 Read the sales value from the graph.
[16148|p546] The diagram now looks like this and the estimated value for the sales is approximately $575.

[16164|p547|T1] TIP
[16165|p547] When commenting on correlation, always make sure that you refer back to the original context of the question.
[16166|p548|T1] WORKED EXAMPLE 1 CONTINUED
[16167|p548] b This is a strong positive correlation because foot length generally increases with height. We can make good predictions of foot length from someone's height and good predictions of someone's height ...
[16168|p548] c The line of best fit is drawn on the diagram. The line should extend across the entire data set and there should be approximately equal numbers of points on either side of the line.
[16169|p548] d The appropriate lines are drawn on the diagram. A height of [EQ] corresponds to a foot length of approximately [EQ] .
[16170|p548] e A foot length of [EQ] corresponds to a height of approximately [EQ]
[16171|p548] Most points are reasonably close to the line, so the correlation is fairly strong. This means that the line of best fit will allow a good level of accuracy when estimates are made.
[16172|p548|T1] TIP
[16173|p548] If you are asked to comment on a prediction that you have made, always keep in mind the strength of the correlation as shown in the diagram. If the correlation is weak you should say that your predict...
[16174|p548|T1] Extrapolation
[16175|p548] Before you draw and interpret some scatter diagrams for yourself you should be aware that there may be problems with making predictions outside the range of the collected data.
[16176|p548] In Worked example 1, the data does not include any heights above [EQ] . The trend may not continue or it may look different for greater heights. So, for example, you should not try to predict the foot...
[16177|p548] The process of extending the line of best fit beyond the collected data is called extrapolation.

[16463|p564] When people are employed they are paid for their work. Earnings can be worked out in different ways:
[16464|p564] - Wages - pay based on a fixed number of hours worked, usually paid weekly. Extra hours of work are called overtime and these are usually paid at a higher rate.
[16465|p564] Salary - pay based on a fixed yearly amount, usually paid monthly. Overtime may be paid, or workers may be given time off in exchange for extra time spent at work.
[16466|p564] - Piece work - pay based on the number of items produced.
[16467|p564] - Commission - pay is based on a percentage of sales made; sometimes a low wage, called a retainer, is paid as well as commission.

[16910|p582] Profit = selling price - cost price
[16911|p582] Loss [EQ] cost price - selling price
[16912|p583|T1] Calculating the selling price, cost price and mark up
[16913|p583] People who sell goods have to decide how much profit they want to make. In other words, they have to decide by how much they will mark up the cost price to make the selling price.
[16914|p583] Cost price + % mark up = selling price
[16915|p583] The cost price is always [EQ] . If you add [EQ] mark up, the selling price will be [EQ] .
[16916|p583|T1] WORKED EXAMPLE 18
[16917|p583] At a market, a trader makes a profit of [EQ] 6.48.
[16918|p583] What is his percentage profit?
[16919|p583|T1] Answer
[16920|p583] Cost price = [EQ]1.08 = $5.40
[16921|p583] Subtract the profit from the selling price to find the cost price of the item.

[16932|p584] A trader sells her product for $39. If her mark up is 30%, what is the cost price of the product?
[16933|p584|T1] Answer
[16934|p584] Cost price + mark up = selling price
[16935|p584] Selling price [EQ] of the cost price
[16936|p584] So, \( \\( {39} = {130}\% \times \) selling price
[16937|p584] To find [EQ]
[16938|p584] [Equation]
[16939|p584] The cost price is $30.
[16940|p584] Divide by 130 to find [EQ] and then multiply by 100 to find [EQ] (which is the cost price).

[16954|p584] 8 VAT at a rate of [EQ] is added each time an item is sold on. The original cost of an item is [EQ] 112.00$ . The item is sold to a wholesaler, who sells it on to a retailer. The retailer sells it to ...
[16955|p584] a How much tax will the item have incurred?
[16956|p584] b Express the tax as a percentage of the original price.
[16957|p585|T1] Discount
[16958|p585] If items are not being sold as quickly as a shop would like or if they want to clear a stock as new fashions come out, then goods may be sold at a discount
[16959|p585] Discount can be treated in the same way as percentage change (loss) as long as you remember that the percentage change is always calculated as a percentage of the original amount.
[16960|p585|T1] WORKED EXAMPLE 21
[16961|p585] During a sale, a shop offers a discount of [EQ] on a pair of jeans originally priced at $75. What is the sale price?
[16962|p585|T1] Answer
[16963|p585] Discount = 15% of $75
[16964|p585] [Equation]
[16965|p585] Sale price = original price - discount
[16966|p585] [Equation]
[16967|p585] You can also work out the price by considering the sale price as a percentage of [EQ] .
[16968|p585] 100 - 15 = 85, so the sale price is 85% of $75:

[17113|p593|T1] 18.1 Review of quadratic graphs (the parabola)
[17114|p593|T1] MATHEMATICAL CONNECTIONS
[17115|p593] You have learnt how to use a table of values to draw curved graphs with equations of the form [EQ] in earlier stages of your studies. You are going to revise that work and then learn how to plot quadr...
[17116|p593] In Chapter 10 you learnt that quadratic equations have an [EQ] term as their highest power. The simplest quadratic equation for a quadratic graph is [EQ] .
[17117|p593] Here is a table showing the values for [EQ] from [EQ] .
[17118|p593] [Table Row] <tr><td>x</td><td>-3</td><td>-2</td><td>-1</td><td>0</td><td>1</td><td>2</td><td>3</td></tr>
[17119|p593] [Table Row] <tr><td>y=x2</td><td>9</td><td>4</td><td>1</td><td>0</td><td>1</td><td>4</td><td>9</td></tr>
[17120|p593] You can use these points to plot and draw a graph just as you did with linear equations. The graph of a quadratic relationship is called a parabola
[17121|p593] Here is the table of values for [EQ] from [EQ] .
[17122|p593] [Table Row] <tr><td>x</td><td>-3</td><td>-2</td><td>-1</td><td>0</td><td>1</td><td>2</td><td>3</td></tr>
[17123|p593] [Table Row] <tr><td>y=-x2</td><td>-9</td><td>-4</td><td>-1</td><td>0</td><td>-1</td><td>-4</td><td>-9</td></tr>
[17124|p593] When you plot these points and draw the parabola you can see that the negative sign in front of the [EQ] has the effect of turning the graph so that it faces downwards.
[17125|p593] If the coefficient [EQ] of in the equation is positive, the parabola is a 'valley' shaped curve.
[17126|p593] If the coefficient of [EQ] in the equation is negative, the parabola is a 'hill' shaped curve.

[17131|p594] The axis of symmetry is the line which divides the parabola into two symmetrical halves. In the two graphs on the previous page, the [EQ] -axis [EQ] is the axis of symmetry.
[17132|p594] The turning point or vertex of the graph is the point at which it changes direction. For both of the graphs, [EQ] and [EQ] , the turning point is at the origin (0, 0).
[17133|p594|T1] TIP
[17134|p594] For most graphs, a turning point is a local minimum or maximum value of [EQ] . For a parabola, if the [EQ] term is positive the turning point will be a minimum. If the [EQ] term is negative, the turni...

[17248|p600] To find the coordinates of the turning point of a parabola, you need to find the axis of symmetry.
[17249|p600] When the equation is in standard form [EQ] , you can find the axis of symmetry using [EQ] . This gives the [EQ] -coordinate of the turning point.

[17482|p611] Suppose you were asked to solve the equation [EQ] .
[17483|p611] To do this, you would need to find the value or values of [EQ] that make [EQ] equal to 0.
[17484|p611] You can try to do this by trial and error, but you will find that the value of [EQ] you need is not a whole number (in fact, it lies between the values of 3 and 4).
[17485|p611] It is much quicker and easier to draw the graph of the equation [EQ] and to use that to find a solution to the equation. Here is the graph:
[17486|p611] [Image]
[17487|p611] The solution to the equation is the point (or points) where [EQ] , in other words you are looking for the value of [EQ] where the graph crosses the [EQ] -axis.
[17488|p611] If you look at the graph you can see that it crosses the [EQ] -axis in two places. The value of [EQ] at these points is 3.3 and [EQ] .
[17489|p611] These two values are sometimes referred to as the roots of the equation [EQ] .
[17490|p611] You can use the graph to find the solution of the equation for different values of [EQ] . Work through Worked example 10 carefully to see how to do this.

[17501|p612] a Since this is the graph of [EQ] simply find the points on the curve that have a [EQ] -coordinate of 0 (i.e. where the curve cuts the [EQ] -axis).
[17502|p612] There are two such points marked A and B on the graph.
[17503|p612] The [EQ] -coordinates of these points are -1.8 and 3.8, so the solutions of the equation [EQ] are [EQ] and [EQ] .
[17504|p612] b Find the points on the curve that have a [EQ] -coordinate of 3. (Draw in the horizontal line [EQ] to help with this.)
[17505|p612] There are two such points, marked [EQ] and [EQ] , on the graph.
[17506|p612] The [EQ] -coordinates of these points are -2.3 and 4.3, so the solutions of the equation [EQ] are [EQ] and [EQ] .
[17507|p612] c Rearrange the equation [EQ] so that the left-hand side matches the equation of the graph you are using.
[17508|p612] Subtracting 7 from both sides gives [EQ] , that is, [EQ] .

[17969|p634|T1] Differentiating sums and differences
[17970|p634] The equation of a curve may involve more than one term and you may be asked to differentiate expressions like [EQ] or [EQ] .
[17971|p634] To do this, you differentiate each term independently.
[17972|p634] You can see this by differentiating [EQ] and then rewriting the answer as a sum of separate terms:
[17973|p634] [Equation]
[17974|p634] You can rewrite [EQ] as the sum:
[17975|p634] [Equation]
[17976|p634] Compare this to the original equation, also written as a sum of separate terms:
[17977|p634] [Equation]
[17978|p634|T1] TIP
[17979|p634] Remember that you will need to use the x-coordinate in each case. Look back at Worked example 24 if you need help.
[17980|p635] You can see that each term has been differentiated independently.
[17981|p635] So we have the rule:
[17982|p635] [Equation]
[17983|p635] You can extend this rule to adding any number of terms together and it also works for subtraction.

[18016|p636|T1] Special cases
[18017|p636] Sometimes the equation of a curve will contain a multiple of [EQ] or a constant term. In the case of a multiple of [EQ] the rule still applies, for example:
[18018|p636] [Equation]
[18019|p636] So, if [EQ] , then [EQ] .
[18020|p636] If your equation involves a constant term, you need to think about what the graph of [EQ] constant looks like. You know from Chapter 10 that this is a horizontal line and has gradient zero.
[18021|p636] So, if [EQ] constant then [EQ]

[18111|p639] When a tennis player hits a tennis ball it will follow a curved path. The highest point in the motion is a stationary point we call the turning point of the curve.
[18112|p639|T1] Turning points
[18113|p639] Earlier in this chapter you learnt that you can use the method of completing the square to find the points at which a quadratic curve is highest or lowest.
[18114|p639] You will now learn how use differentiation to do the same thing, and then compare the answer that you get from completing the square.
[18115|p639] Think about the curve with equation [EQ] . The diagram shows the curve with a tangent drawn at the lowest point.
[18116|p639] Note that the gradient of the tangent is zero. Any point where the gradient of a quadratic curve is zero is known as a stationary point. If the point is also either a maximum or minimum point then we ...
[18117|p639] If the gradient of the tangent is zero at this point, then so is [EQ] .
[18118|p639] [Equation]
[18119|p639] Substitute this [EQ] -value into the original equation to find the coordinates of the turning point:
[18120|p639] [Equation]
[18121|p639] You can see that the point [EQ] is the lowest point of the graph. The value [EQ] is known as the minimum value of [EQ] .
[18122|p639] If you complete the square to check the answer, you can see that

[18130|p640|T1] Using the shape of the graph
[18131|p640] It is easy to see which points are maxima (the plural of maximum) and minima if you use the shape of the curve to help you.
[18132|p640] In the case of [EQ] the coefficient of [EQ] is positive, which means that the curve is U shaped. The turning point must be a minimum as it is lower than the rest of the curve.
[18133|p640] [Image]
[18134|p640|T1] TIP
[18135|p640] Remember that the coefficient of a power of [EQ] is the number that appears in front of it.
[18136|p640] If the coefficient of [EQ] is negative then the curve is [EQ] shaped, and the turning point is now a maximum.
[18137|p640] [Image]
[18138|p640|T1] Finding the gradient either side of the turning point
[18139|p640] You can test find the gradient of other points on the graph by substituting different values for [EQ] .
[18140|p640] In the case of [EQ] , the gradient is equal to [EQ] and the turning point is at [EQ] .
[18141|p641] Substitute [EQ] and [EQ] to find the gradient on either side of the turning point:
[18142|p641] At [EQ] , [EQ] . The curve is sloping downwards.
[18143|p641] At [EQ] , [EQ] . The curve is sloping upwards.
[18144|p641] This shows that the curve is sloping downwards to the left of the turning point and upwards on the right, so the turning point must be a minimum point.
[18145|p641|T1] Using the second derivative
[18146|p641] A third method is to differentiate the function a second time. This gives the second derivative and you write this as [EQ] . The second derivative gives the rate of change of the gradient, so it tells...
[18147|p641] If the value of the second derivative at the turning point is:
[18148|p641] - positive, the gradient is increasing and the turning point is a minimum point - negative, the gradient is decreasing and the turning point is a maximum point.

[18170|p642] At [EQ] , [EQ] so the curve slopes upwards.
[18171|p642] At [EQ] so the curve slopes downwards.
[18172|p642] So [EQ] is a maximum point.
[18173|p642] For (1, 0) find the gradient at 0.9 and 1.1:
[18174|p642] At [EQ] so the curve slopes downwards.
[18175|p642] At [EQ] so the curve slopes upwards.

[18225|p645] A reciprocal equation is an equation of the form [EQ] or [EQ] .
[18226|p645] The graph of a reciprocal equation is a two-part curve called a hyperbola.

[18228|p645] You can find the solution to simultaneous equations using the points of intersection of two graphs.
[18229|p645] Linear, quadratic, cubic and reciprocal terms can occur in the same equation. It is possible to draw graphs of these curves by constructing a table of values and then plotting the points.
[18230|p645] An exponential equation has the form [EQ] . These equations produce steep curved graphs.
[18231|p645] You can draw a tangent to a curve and use it to find the gradient of the curve at the point where the tangent touches it.

[18374|p651] .
[18375|p651] .
[18376|p651|T1] Line symmetry
[18377|p651] If a shape can be folded so that one half fits exactly over the other half, it has line symmetry (also called reflection symmetry).
[18378|p651] Triangle A is symmetrical. The dotted line divides it into two identical parts.
[18379|p651] [Image]
[18380|p651] Triangle B is not symmetrical. You cannot draw a line which will divide it into two identical halves.
[18381|p651] [Image]
[18382|p651] If you place a mirror on the dividing line on shape A, the view in the mirror will be that of the whole triangle. The line is called the line of symmetry or mirror line of the shape.

[18515|p657|T1] Plane symmetry
[18516|p657] A plane is a flat surface. If you can cut a solid in half along a plane so that each half is the mirror image of the other, then the solid has plane symmetry.

[18561|p659] A circle has line symmetry about any diameter and it has rotational symmetry about its centre. From these facts a number of results can be deduced:
[18562|p659] 1 The perpendicular bisector of a chord passes through the centre.
[18563|p659] 2 Equal chords are equidistant from the centre, and chords equidistant from the centre are equal in length.
[18564|p659] 3 Two tangents drawn to a circle from the same point outside the circle are equal in length.

[18566|p659] The Earth rotates about an axis of symmetry. Where the Earth's axis meets the Earth's surface you will find the Geographical North and South Poles.

[18568|p660] Make sure you remember the correct names of circle parts.
[18569|p660] These were covered in Chapter 3 and revised in the Getting started activities in this chapter.
[18570|p660] The perpendicular bisector of a chord passes through the centre
[18571|p660] The perpendicular bisector of chord [EQ] is the locus of points equidistant from [EQ] and [EQ] .
[18572|p660] But centre [EQ] is equidistant from [EQ] and [EQ] (OA and OB are radii of circle with centre [EQ] ).
[18573|p660] ... [EQ] must be on the perpendicular bisector of [EQ] .
[18574|p660] This result can be expressed in other ways:
[18575|p660] The perpendicular from the centre of a circle to a chord meets the chord at its midpoint.
[18576|p660] The line joining the centre of a circle to the midpoint of a chord is perpendicular to the chord.
[18577|p660] You can use this fact to find the lengths of chords and the lengths of sides of right-angled triangles drawn between the centre and the chord.

[18591|p661|T1] Equal chords are equidistant from the centre and chords equidistant from the centre are equal in length
[18592|p661] If chords [EQ] and [EQ] are the same length, then [EQ] , and vice versa.
[18593|p661] This is true because triangle OAM is congruent to triangle ODN and because the circle has rotational symmetry about its centre, [EQ] .
[18594|p661] When you are asked for the distance from a point to a line, it is always the perpendicular distance which is expected. This is the shortest distance from the point to the line.

[18611|p661] The result is [EQ] .
[18612|p661] In addition:
[18613|p661] the tangents subtend equal angles at the centre (i.e. angle [EQ] angle [EQ]

[18667|p665|T1] The angle between the tangent and radius is [EQ]
[18668|p665] Look at the diagram carefully.
[18669|p665] A tangent touches a circle at one point only.
[18670|p665] If you draw lines from the centre to points on the tangent, you can see that the shortest possible line is a radius. (OA).
[18671|p665] You already know that the shortest distance from a point to a line is the perpendicular distance from the point to the line.
[18672|p665] So, the radius is perpendicular to the tangent.
[18673|p665] It follows that angles [EQ] and [EQ] are right angles.

[18962|p681|T1] 20.1 Histograms
[18963|p681] A histogram shows the distribution of continuous, grouped data. Look at this histogram showing the ages of adult patients admitted to hospital with a diagnosis of pneumonia.
[18964|p681] [Image]
[18965|p681] In this case, the class interval is 8 years. The shape of the graph shows that most patients admitted to hospital for pneumonia tend to be older (70 years or more) and that fewer middle-aged adults ar...
[18966|p681|T1] LINK
[18967|p681] Histograms are one of the most useful tools in epidemiology. They are used to organise and display a large set of measurements or numerical data in a simple way, so they are often used to display data...
[18968|p682] This histogram shows data grouped in unequal intervals. You can see that the first interval [EQ] is much larger than the others.
[18969|p682] [Image]
[18970|p682] On a histogram with unequal class intervals:
[18971|p682] - The horizontal scale is continuous and each column of the graph is drawn above a particular class interval.
[18972|p682] The frequency of the data is shown by the area of the bars. Frequency density is shown against the vertical axis.
[18973|p682|T1] Working with unequal class intervals
[18974|p682] When the class intervals are not equal you cannot use the height of each bar to work out the frequency. Instead, you need to use the area of each bar.
[18975|p682] When the class intervals are unequal you use the vertical scale to show the frequency density:
[18976|p682] [Equation]
[18977|p682] Frequency density takes into account the frequency relative to the size of the class interval and is used for comparing data in different-sized intervals.

[18980|p682|T1] MATHEMATICAL CONNECTIONS
[18981|p682] You worked with grouped data in Chapter 4.
[18982|p682|T1] TIP
[18983|p682] By rearranging the formula, you can see that frequency is equal to the area of a bar. You can use this to help you read frequencies from the histogram. Many questions are based on this principle.
[18984|p682|T1] WORKED EXAMPLE 1
[18985|p682] Here is a table showing the heights of 25 plants. Draw a histogram to show these results.
[18986|p682] [Table Row] <tr><td>Height in cm</td><td>Number of plants</td></tr>
[18987|p682] [Table Row] <tr><td>5 ≤ h ≤ 15</td><td>4</td></tr>
[18988|p682] [Table Row] <tr><td>15 &lt; h ≤ 20</td><td>8</td></tr>
[18989|p682] [Table Row] <tr><td>20 &lt; h ≤ 25</td><td>7</td></tr>
[18990|p682] [Table Row] <tr><td>25 &lt; h ≤ 40</td><td>6</td></tr>
[18991|p683|T1] WORKED EXAMPLE 1 CONTINUED
[18992|p683|T1] Answer
[18993|p683] First work out the frequency density by adding columns to your frequency distribution table like this:
[18994|p683] [Table Row] <tr><td>Height (h) in cm</td><td>Number of plants</td><td>Class width</td><td>Frequency density (frequency + class width)</td></tr>
[18995|p683] [Table Row] <tr><td>5 ≤ h ≤ 15</td><td>4</td><td>10</td><td>4/10 = 0.4</td></tr>
[18996|p683] [Table Row] <tr><td>15 &lt; h ≤ 20</td><td>8</td><td>5</td><td>8/5 = 1.6</td></tr>
[18997|p683] [Table Row] <tr><td>20 &lt; h ≤ 25</td><td>7</td><td>5</td><td>7/5 = 1.4</td></tr>
[18998|p683] [Table Row] <tr><td>25 &lt; h ≤ 40</td><td>6</td><td>15</td><td>6/15 = 0.4</td></tr>
[18999|p683] Next draw the axes. You will need to decide on a suitable scale for both the horizontal and the vertical axes.
[19000|p683] Once you have done this, draw the histogram, paying careful attention to the scales on the axes.
[19001|p683] [Image]
[19002|p683|T1] TIP
[19003|p683] If you plotted the data against frequency instead of frequency density (see histogram), it looks like there are more plants in the 25-40 class compared to the 5-10 class but actually, their frequency ...
[19004|p683] [Image]
[19005|p683] interval is misleading here, so we use frequency density as it is a better way to compare frequencies in classes of different sizes.
[19006|p683|T1] TIP
[19007|p683] The heights in cm are the class intervals. The number of plants is the frequency.

[19274|p695|T1] Quartiles
[19275|p695] In Chapter 12 you found the range (the biggest value - the smallest value) to see how dispersed various sets of data were. However, the range is easily affected by outliers (extreme or unusual values)...
[19276|p695] You can divide the data shown on a cumulative frequency curve into quartiles to find the interquartile range, which is more representative than the range because it is not affected by extreme values.
[19277|p695] This cumulative frequency curve the marks obtained by 64 students in a test.
[19278|p695] [Image]
[19279|p695] When finding the positions of the quartiles from a cumulative frequency curve you do not use the [EQ] and [EQ] rules that you met for discrete data in
[19280|p695] Chapter 12. Instead, you use: [EQ] and [EQ] .
[19281|p695] Looking at the curve, you can see that:
[19282|p695] 48 students scored less than 15 marks. 15 marks is the upper quartile or third quartile [EQ] .
[19283|p695] 32 students scored less than 13 marks. 13 marks is the second quartile [EQ] , or median mark.
[19284|p695] 16 students scored less than 11 marks. 11 marks is the lower quartile or first quartile [EQ]
[19285|p695|T1] MATHEMATICAL CONNECTIONS
[19286|p695] Revise the work you did on quartiles and the interquartile range in Chapter 12 if you need to.
[19287|p695|T1] TIP
[19288|p695] Describing how 'dispersed' data is, is the same as describing how 'spread out' it is. So we can say that the range is a 'measure of dispersion' or a 'measure of spread'.

[19290|p695] Whole number values are being used in this example to make it easier to understand. Usually your answers will be estimates and they will involve decimal fractions.
[19291|p696|T1] The interquartile range
[19292|p696] The interquartile range (IQR) is the difference between the upper and lower quartiles: [EQ] .
[19293|p696] In effect, this is the range of the middle [EQ] of the scores, or the median of the upper half of the values minus the median of the lower half of the values.
[19294|p696] In the example about marks scored by students, the IQR [EQ]
[19295|p696] Because the interquartile range does not use any extreme small or large values it is considered a more reliable measure of spread than the range.

[19380|p700] When cumulative frequencies are plotted they give a cumulative frequency curve or ogive.
[19381|p700] The curve can be used to estimate the median value in the data.
[19382|p700] The data can be divided into four equal groups called quartiles. The interquartile range is the difference between the upper and lower quartiles [EQ] .
[19383|p700] Large amounts of data can be divided into percentiles, which divide the data into 100 equal groups. If a score of 20 out of 25 is at the 82nd percentile it means that [EQ] of the scores are below 20.

[19753|p719] [Table Row] <tr><td>y</td><td>12</td><td>4</td><td>b</td><td>48</td><td>d</td><td>14</td></tr>
[19754|p719|T1] TIP
[19755|p719] Rates are often used in daily life. When we write a rate such as kilometres per hour, we use the abbreviation km/h. The / means 'per'.
[19756|p720|T1] 21.1 Working with ratio
[19757|p720] A ratio is a numerical comparison of amounts. The order in which you write the amounts is very important. For example, if there is one teacher for every 25 students in a school, then the ratio of teac...
[19758|p720] We normally write ratios in the form [EQ] , but when we work with them, it is sometimes useful to express the ratio as a fraction.
[19759|p720] Think about the teacher to student ratio 1:25. This means there is 1 teacher for every 25 students.
[19760|p720] You can write this as [EQ] . This fraction compares the number of teachers with the number of students. It means that there is [EQ] as many teachers as there are students.
[19761|p720] So, if there are 150 students you can use the fraction to work out how many teachers there are:
[19762|p720] [Equation]
[19763|p720] So, for 150 students there will be 6 teachers.
[19764|p720] 6 is equivalent to [EQ] and this matches the ratio 1:25.
[19765|p720] When you write two quantities as a ratio, you must make sure they are both in the same units. For example, the ratio of 20c to $1 is not 20:1, it is 20:100 because there are 100 cents in a dollar.
[19766|p720|T1] Writing ratios in simplest form
[19767|p720] Ratios are in their simplest form when you write them using the smallest whole numbers possible. The ratio of 20:100 above is not in its simplest form. You can simplify ratios in the same way that you...

[19774|p720] b white paint to the total amount of paint in the mixture?
[19775|p720] c red paint to the total amount of paint in the mixture?
[19776|p720|T1] TIP
[19777|p720] When you say a ratio, you use the word 'to', so you say 5:2 as '5 to 2'.

[20017|p729] There are two main types of problems involving scale:
[20018|p729] - calculating the real length of an object given its scaled length
[20019|p729] - calculating the scaled length of an object given its real length.
[20020|p729] In both cases you will be told one of the lengths and the scale, expressed as 'length on the diagram: real length'.
[20021|p729] You can write the scale as fractions and cross-multiply to find the unknown length.

[20281|p739|T1] Speed in distance-time graphs
[20282|p739] The steepness gradient of a graph gives an indication of speed.
[20283|p739] - A straight line on a graph indicates a constant speed. Any change in the angle of the line indicates a change of speed.
[20284|p739] [Image]
[20285|p740] The steeper the graph, the greater the speed.
[20286|p740] An upward slope and a downward slope represent movement in opposite directions.
[20287|p740] The distance-time graph shown is for a person who walks, cycles and then drives for three equal periods of time. For each period, speed is given by the formula:
[20288|p740] [Equation]
[20289|p740] [Image]
[20290|p740] Speed is a rate of change. A straight line from the origin shows a constant rate of change and you can use the formula [EQ] to find the rate of change.
[20291|p740] If the gradient changes along the graph, the speed will be different for different time periods.
[20292|p740] The gradient precisely describes the steepness of a line.
[20293|p740] In the diagram, the steepness of line [EQ] is measured by: increase in y-coordinate increase in x-coordinate
[20294|p740] This is the same as [EQ] or gradient of a straight line graph.
[20295|p740] A positive gradient means that as [EQ] increases [EQ] also increases.
[20296|p740] On a distance-time graph, the [EQ] value indicates distance from the starting point, so a positive gradient means the object is moving away from the starting point. A zero gradient means the [EQ] -val...
[20297|p740] For a distance-time graph:
[20298|p740] [Equation]
[20299|p740] Therefore, the gradient of the graph tells you the speed of the object and its direction of motion. This is known as the velocity of the object.
[20300|p740] [Image]
[20301|p741] Here is another example:
[20302|p741] The travel graph represents a car journey.
[20303|p741] The horizontal sections have zero gradient (so the car was stationary during these times).
[20304|p741] For section [EQ] , the gradient is positive:
[20305|p741] [Equation]
[20306|p741] the velocity was [EQ] in the direction away from home.
[20307|p741] For section [EQ] , the gradient is negative:
[20308|p741] [Equation]
[20309|p741] ..the velocity was [EQ]
[20310|p741] For section [EQ] the gradient is negative:
[20311|p741] [Equation]

[20317|p741] negative if the line slopes down from left to right.
[20318|p741|T1] TIP
[20319|p741] When the velocity is positive, the direction of motion is away from home. When the velocity is negative, the direction is towards home.

[20372|p744] The speed increases steadily reaching [EQ] after 15 seconds.
[20373|p744] The train travels at a constant speed (horizontal section) of [EQ] for 25 seconds.
[20374|p744] The train then slows down at a steady rate till it stops.
[20375|p744] The entire journey takes 60 seconds.
[20376|p744] Look at the first part of the journey again.
[20377|p744] The speed increased by [EQ] in 15 seconds.
[20378|p744] [EQ] is the gradient of the line representing the first part of the journey.
[20379|p744] This is a rate of [EQ] every second. This is the rate of acceleration. You write this as [EQ] (or [EQ]
[20380|p744] For a speed-time graph, the gradient = acceleration.
[20381|p744] A positive gradient (acceleration) is an increase in speed.

[20549|p752] A person travelling at [EQ] takes 24 minutes to get home from work. How long will the journey take if they travel at [EQ] ?
[20550|p752|T1] Answer
[20551|p752] 30km/h takes 24 minutes.
[20552|p752] This is inverse proportion; as one value decreases the other increases.
[20553|p752] So, [EQ] would take [EQ] minutes.
[20554|p752] To get [EQ] you divide the speed by 30, so multiply the time by 30.
[20555|p752] at 36km/h it will take 30x24 36
[20556|p752] To get [EQ] you multiply the speed by 36, so divide the time by 36.

[20702|p757] A ratio is a comparison of two or more quantities in a set order. Ratios can be expressed in the form [EQ] or [EQ] . Ratios have no units.
[20703|p757] Ratios can be simplified by multiplying or dividing both quantities by the same number. This method produces equivalent ratios.
[20704|p757] Map scales are good examples of ratios in everyday life. The scale of a map is usually given in the form [EQ] . This allows you to convert map distances to real distances using the ratio scale.
[20705|p757] A rate is a comparison of two different quantities. Usually a rate gives an amount of one quantity per unit of the other. Rates must include the units of the quantities.
[20706|p757] Speed is one of the most common rates of change. Speed = distance ÷ time.
[20707|p757] Kinematic graphs are used to show relationships between:
[20708|p757] distance and time (distance-time graph)
[20709|p757] speed and time (speed-time graph)
[20710|p757] and to solve problems in these areas.
[20711|p757|T1] TIP
[20712|p757] Sometimes you may see 'varies as' written instead of 'is directly proportional to'. Similarly, 'varies inversely with' means 'is inversely proportional to'.

[20714|p758] The gradient of a distance-time graph shows how the speed changes over time.
[20715|p758] Proportion is a constant ratio between two sets of numbers.
[20716|p758] When quantities are in direct proportion they increase or decrease at the same rate.
[20717|p758] When quantities are inversely proportional, one increases as the other decreases.

[21164|p776|T1] 22.3 Functions and function notation
[21165|p776] A function is a rule or set of instructions for changing one number (the input) into another number (the output). If [EQ] is a function of [EQ] , then the value of [EQ] depends on the values you use f...
[21166|p776|T1] Function notation
[21167|p776] Function notation is a mathematical way of writing equations (functions). Function notation is widely used in computer applications and also in technical fields.
[21168|p776] You already know that a function can be represented in a number of ways. For example, you can show the function [EQ] using:
[21169|p776] a function machine (flow diagram): Input [EQ] output
[21170|p776] a mapping diagram:
[21171|p776] [Image]
[21172|p776] a table of values:
[21173|p776] [Table Row] <tr><td>x</td><td>1</td><td>2</td><td>3</td></tr>
[21174|p776] [Table Row] <tr><td>y</td><td>3</td><td>7</td><td>11</td></tr>
[21175|p776] a set of [EQ] and [EQ] -values (coordinates): [EQ] In set notation this is written as [EQ]
[21176|p776] a graph:
[21177|p776] [Image]
[21178|p776] When you write the equation [EQ] in function notation it becomes [EQ] .
[21179|p777] You read [EQ] as 'the function of [EQ] ' or 'f of [EQ] '.
[21180|p777] [Image]
[21181|p777] If [EQ] , then [EQ] means the value of the function when [EQ] .
[21182|p777] In other words, [EQ] .
[21183|p777] Similarly. [EQ] .
[21184|p777] The number [EQ] is sometimes called the image of [EQ] (under function [EQ] ).
[21185|p777] When a problem involves two or more functions, you use different letters to represent them. For example, you could have:
[21186|p777] [Equation]
[21187|p777] You can show the steps you take to work out the value of any function [EQ] using a simple flow diagram. For example, you can represent the function [EQ] as:
[21188|p777] [Equation]
[21189|p777] The function [EQ] can be represented as:
[21190|p777] [Equation]
[21191|p777] Note that the flow charts show the same operations but, as they are done in a different order, they produce different results.

[21196|p777|T1] TIP
[21197|p777] In function notation you leave out the [EQ] and replace it with the notation [EQ] . So, if [EQ] is a function and [EQ] is an input, then [EQ] is the output when [EQ] is applied to [EQ] .

[21425|p783|T1] Inverse functions
[21426|p783] The inverse of any function (f) is the function that will do the opposite of f. In other words, the function that will undo the effects of f. So, if f maps 4 onto 13, then the inverse of f will map 13...
[21427|p783] In effect, when [EQ] is applied to a number and the inverse of [EQ] is applied to the result, you will get back to the number you started with.
[21428|p783] In simple cases, you can find the inverse of a function by inspection. For example, the inverse of [EQ] must be [EQ] because subtraction is the inverse of addition; to undo add five you have to subtra...
[21429|p783] Similarly, the inverse of [EQ] is [EQ] , because to undo multiply by two you have to divide by two.
[21430|p783] The inverse of the function (f) is written as [EQ]

[21432|p784] and, if [EQ] , then [EQ] .

[21435|p784] You briefly worked with inverse functions in trigonometry in Chapter 15.
[21436|p784|T1] Finding the inverse of a function
[21437|p784] There are two methods of finding the inverse:
[21438|p784] Method 1: using a flow diagram.
[21439|p784] In this method you draw a flow diagram for the function and then work out the inverse by 'reversing' the flow to undo the operations in the boxes.
[21440|p784] Method 2: reversing the mapping.
[21441|p784] In this method you use the fact that if [EQ] maps [EQ] onto [EQ] , then [EQ] maps [EQ] onto [EQ] .
[21442|p784] To find [EQ] you have to find a value of [EQ] that corresponds to a given value of [EQ] .
[21443|p784] Worked examples 17-20 show how to find the inverse for two functions, first using method 1 and then using method 2.

[21650|p791] Transformation means change. In mathematics, a transformation is a change in the position or size of an object (or point). In this section you will deal with four types of transformations:
[21651|p791] - reflection (a flip or mirror image)
[21652|p791] rotation (a turn)
[21653|p791] translation (a slide movement)

[21661|p791] A transformation produces an image of the original object in a new position or at a different size. A point, [EQ] , on the object is labelled as [EQ] on the image.
[21662|p791] Reflections, rotations and translations change the position of an object, but they do not change its size. So, the object and its image are congruent. If you place the object and its image on top of e...

[21748|p795|T1] Rotation
[21749|p795] A rotation is a turn around a fixed point. Rotation occurs when an object is turned around a given point. Rotation can be clockwise or anti-clockwise. The fixed point is called the centre of rotation ...
[21750|p795] In this diagram, the object has been rotated [EQ] clockwise about the centre of rotation (a vertex of the object).
[21751|p795] [Image]
[21752|p796|T1] Properties of rotation
[21753|p796] A rotation through [EQ] is a half turn; a rotation through [EQ] is a quarter turn.
[21754|p796] A point and its image are equidistant from the centre of rotation.
[21755|p796] Each point of an object moves along the arc of a circle whose centre is the centre of rotation. All the circles are concentric:
[21756|p796] [Image]
[21757|p796] Only the centre of rotation is invariant.
[21758|p796] The object and the image are congruent after rotation.
[21759|p796] [Image]
[21760|p796] The perpendicular bisector of a line joining a point and its image passes through the centre of rotation.
[21761|p796] [Image]
[21762|p796] A line segment and its image are equal in length.
[21763|p796] [Image]
[21764|p796|T1] MATHEMATICAL CONNECTIONS
[21765|p796] You dealt with rotation when you studied rotational symmetry in Chapter 19.
[21766|p796] [Image]
[21767|p797] To describe a rotation you need to give:
[21768|p797] the centre of rotation
[21769|p797] the amount of turn [EQ] or [EQ]
[21770|p797] the direction of the turn (clockwise or anti-clockwise).
[21771|p797] You can use thin paper or tracing paper to help you with rotations:
[21772|p797] 1 Trace the shape and label the vertices.
[21773|p797] 2 Place the tracing over the object.
[21774|p797] 3 Use the point of a pair of compasses or pen to hold the paper at the point (centre) of rotation.
[21775|p797] 4 Turn the paper through the given turn.
[21776|p797] 5 The new position of the shape is the image.
[21777|p797|T1] TIP
[21778|p797] The centre of rotation will normally be the origin (0, 0), a vertex of the shape or the midpoint of a side of the shape. The amount of turn will normally be a multiple of [EQ] .

[21811|p799|T1] Identifying the reasons for mistakes
[21812|p799] Research shows that mistakes are often related to misconceptions or misunderstanding and that simply finding and correcting mistakes does not help to prevent similar mistakes in the future.
[21813|p799] Identify any mistakes you made in this exercise.
[21814|p799] - Analyse why you made these mistakes. Decide if you were careless or whether you misunderstood any of the concepts.
[21815|p799] - Suggest one thing you will do so that you don't make similar mistakes in the future.
[21816|p799|T1] Translation
[21817|p799] A translation, or slide, is the movement of an object over a specified distance along a line. The object is not twisted or turned. The movement is indicated by positive or negative signs according to ...
[21818|p800] You can describe a translation using a column vector: [EQ] . This means a movement of [EQ] units in the [EQ] -direction (left or right) and a movement of [EQ] units in the [EQ] -direction (up or down)...
[21819|p800] In this diagram, the triangle T is translated to five positions. Each translation is described below the diagram:
[21820|p800] [Image]
[21821|p800|T1] MATHEMATICAL CONNECTIONS
[21822|p800] You will deal with vectors in more detail later in this chapter.
[21823|p800] Position 1 [EQ]
[21824|p800] Position 2 [EQ]
[21825|p800] Position 3 [EQ]
[21826|p800] Position 4 [EQ]
[21827|p800] Position 5 [EQ]
[21828|p800|T1] Properties of translation
[21829|p800] A translation moves every point in an object the same distance in the same direction, so you can describe the translation of the whole object by describing the translation of any one point.
[21830|p800] To specify the translation, give both the distance and direction of the translation using a column vector [EQ] .
[21831|p800] No part of the object is invariant.
[21832|p800] The object and the image are congruent.
[21833|p800|T1] TIP
[21834|p800] Be careful when writing column vectors. There is no dividing line, so they should not look like fractions.
[21835|p800] Write [EQ] rather
[21836|p800] than [EQ] they mean different things.
[21837|p801|T1] Exercise 23.3

[21840|p801] b a triangle translated 5cm to the right.
[21841|p801] 2 Write column vectors to describe the translations from A to B and from A to C in each of the following diagrams.

[21849|p801] a three units to the right and two units down
[21850|p801] b three units to the left and two units down
[21851|p801] c three units up and one unit to the left
[21852|p801] d three units down and four units right.
[21853|p801] [Image]
[21854|p801|T1] TIP
[21855|p801] The phrase 'under the translation [EQ]
[21856|p801] means the same as after translating
[21857|p801] using the vector [EQ]
[21858|p801] 4 On squared paper, draw [EQ] - and [EQ] -axes and mark the points [EQ] , [EQ] and [EQ] .

[21863|p802] a Represent this translation accurately on a set of axes.
[21864|p802] b Give the coordinates of the vertices of the image.
[21865|p802|T1] Enlargement
[21866|p802] When you enlarge a shape, you make it bigger (or smaller). In an enlargement the lengths of sides on the object are multiplied by a constant scale factor [EQ] to form the image. The sizes of angles do...
[21867|p802] [Equation]
[21868|p802] If the scale factor is given, you can find the lengths of corresponding sides by multiplication.
[21869|p802] This diagram shows a square which has been enlarged by a scale factor of 1.5.
[21870|p802] This means that [EQ] .
[21871|p802] [Image]
[21872|p802] When an object is enlarged from a fixed point, it has a centre of enlargement. The centre of enlargement determines the position of the image. Lines drawn through corresponding points on the object an...
[21873|p802] You can determine the scale factor by comparing any two corresponding sides, for example:
[21874|p802] [Equation]
[21875|p802] or by comparing the distances of two corresponding vertices from the origin, for example:
[21876|p802] [Equation]
[21877|p802] [Image]
[21878|p802|T1] MATHEMATICAL CONNECTIONS
[21879|p802] 'Scale factor' was introduced in Chapter 11. It is the multiplier that tells you how much one shape is larger than another.
[21880|p802|T1] LINK
[21881|p802] When you pinch an image on a phone screen to make it bigger you are transforming the image by enlargement.
[21882|p803|T1] Properties of enlargement
[21883|p803] The centre of enlargement can be anywhere (inside the object, outside the object or on a vertex or line).
[21884|p803] - A scale factor greater than 1 enlarges the object whilst a scale factor between 0 and 1 reduces the size of the object, although this is still described as an enlargement.
[21885|p803] An object and its image are similar (not congruent) with sides in the ratio [EQ] where [EQ] is the scale factor.
[21886|p803] - Angles of the object are invariant.
[21887|p803|T1] TIP
[21888|p803] Remember, similar shapes are the same shape but not the same size. Congruent shapes are the same size.

[21997|p811|T1] Combining transformations

[22054|p817|T1] LINK
[22055|p817] The word 'vector' means carrier. In a mathematical context, it is about picking an object up and translating it. In a biological context, animals (including humans) that carry diseases are known as ve...
[22056|p817] Some quantities are best described by giving both a magnitude (size) and a direction. For example, a wind speed of [EQ] from the southeast or an acceleration upwards of [EQ] . Force, velocity, displac...
[22057|p817] Other quantities such as time, temperature, speed, mass and area can be described by only giving their magnitude (they don't have a direction). These quantities are called scalars.
[22058|p817] A vector is an ordered pair of numbers that you can use to describe a translation. The ordered pair gives both magnitude and direction.
[22059|p817|T1] Vector notation
[22060|p817] Vectors can be represented by a directed line segment as shown in the diagrams. Note that the notation is either a small letter with a wavy line beneath it or a bold letter: e.g. [EQ] or [EQ] .
[22061|p817] [Image]
[22062|p817] Vectors can also be represented by a named line such as [EQ] . In such cases, the vector is denoted by [EQ] . The order of letters is important because they give the direction of the line. [EQ] is not...
[22063|p817|T1] Writing vectors as number pairs

[22120|p821|T1] Equal vectors
[22121|p821] Equal vectors have the same size (magnitude) and direction. As vectors are usually independent of position, they can start at any point. The same vector can be at many places in a diagram.
[22122|p821] In the diagram, [EQ] and [EQ] are equal vectors.
[22123|p821] [Image]
[22124|p821] [Equation]
[22125|p821] When equal vectors share a common point, for example when [EQ] you can deduce that that the points [EQ] and [EQ] all lie on a straight line. When points lie on a straight line, they are collinear.

[22131|p822] Here is another example.
[22132|p822] A force, represented by vector [EQ] , is needed to move a [EQ] concrete block.
[22133|p822] If you want to move a [EQ] concrete block, you need to apply twice the force. In other words, you would need to apply [EQ] or [EQ] .
[22134|p822] A force of 2f has the same direction as f, but it has twice its magnitude.
[22135|p822] [Image]
[22136|p822] Multiplying any vector [EQ] by a scalar [EQ] , gives [EQ] .
[22137|p822] Vector a multiplied by 2 is the vector 2a. Vector 2a is twice as long as vector a, but they have the same direction. In other words, they are either parallel or in a straight line.
[22138|p822] [Equation]
[22139|p822] Vector a multiplied by -1 is the vector -a, which is opposite in direction to a, but with the same magnitude as a.

[22519|p839] In this chapter, you are going to use diagrams to show possible outcomes and calculate the probability of combined events to deepen your understanding of probability concepts.
[22520|p839|T1] GETTING STARTED

[22534|p840|T1] 24.1 Using tree diagrams to show
[22535|p840|T1] outcomes
[22536|p840] In Chapter 8 you used sample space diagrams to show the sample space and all possible outcomes for statistical experiments.
[22537|p840] If you roll a dice and flip a coin, the sample space diagram could look like this:
[22538|p840] [Table Row] <tr><td>Dice Coin</td><td>1</td><td>2</td><td>3</td><td>4</td><td>5</td><td>6</td></tr>
[22539|p840] [Table Row] <tr><td>Heads</td><td>H1</td><td>H2</td><td>H3</td><td>H4</td><td>H5</td><td>H6</td></tr>
[22540|p840] [Table Row] <tr><td>Tails</td><td>T1</td><td>T2</td><td>T3</td><td>T4</td><td>T5</td><td>T6</td></tr>
[22541|p840] These outcomes can also be shown on a tree diagram:
[22542|p840] [Image]
[22543|p840] On a tree diagram the outcomes are written at the end of the branches.
[22544|p840] Think about the event 'getting all heads' when you toss a coin three times in a row. You cannot show all the possible outcomes for this on a possibility diagram, but you can show them on a tree diagra...

[22574|p842|T1] The probability of combined events on a tree diagram
[22575|p842] To find the probability of one particular combination of outcomes:
[22576|p842] - multiply the probabilities on consecutive branches, for example the probability of throwing a 5 and getting an H is [EQ] .
[22577|p842] To find the probability when there is more than one favourable combination or when the events are mutually exclusive:
[22578|p842] - multiply the probabilities on consecutive branches
[22579|p842] - add the probabilities (of each favourable combination) obtained by multiplication, for example, throwing 1 or 2 and getting an H is

[22678|p846] [EQ] means the universal set. In probability this is the sample space, or set of all possible outcomes. In this example the sample space is [EQ] people.
[22679|p846] [EQ] means the number of elements in set [EQ]
[22680|p846] [Equation]
[22681|p846] [EQ] means the probability that an element is in set [EQ] . You can write this as the number of elements in set [EQ] as a fraction of the sample space.
[22682|p846] Remember to include the elements in the intersection in set [EQ] .
[22683|p846] [Equation]
[22684|p846] [EQ] is the intersection of sets [EQ] and [EQ] . It is the elements shared by [EQ] and [EQ] . You write the probability of the two events happening as [EQ] and [EQ] . This is the same as [EQ] , the pr...

[22693|p847] 15 people said they liked vegetables and 18 said they liked fruit.
[22694|p847] Assuming that everyone surveyed liked fruit or vegetables or both, draw a Venn diagram and use it to work out the probability that a person chosen at random from this group will like:
[22695|p847] a both fruit and vegetables

[22810|p851] If the probability of an event depends on the outcome of a previous event then the probability is said to be conditional.
[22811|p851] For two events [EQ] and [EQ] , [EQ] given that [EQ] has happened) refers to the conditional probability of [EQ] happening given that [EQ] has already happened.
[22812|p851] The way that you work out the conditional probability depends on whether the events are independent or not.
[22813|p851|T1] Independent events
[22814|p851] Imagine you roll two normal six-sided dice.
[22815|p851] The first dice lands on a 6. What is the probability of the second dice also landing on 6?
[22816|p851] These two events are independent. The score on the second dice is not affected by the outcome of the first.

[22818|p851] [EQ] given that [EQ] has happened) [EQ]
[22819|p851] so in this case, the probability of getting a 6 with the second dice is [EQ] .
[22820|p851|T1] Dependent events
[22821|p851] If two events [EQ] and [EQ] are dependent, the first event does affect the probability of the second event.

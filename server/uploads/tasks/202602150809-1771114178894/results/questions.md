The Sluggers baseball team ended the season with the highest win percentage in their division. What is the Slugger's winning percentage written as a fraction?
Statistics are often rounded. Here, the decimal 0.555... or 0.5 is rounded to the thousandths place.
![image](images/e695708c7ab9a22c89da7c958b07f8b86b65c22d86e042d4d01df153d70a6ba1.jpg)
Locate 0.555... on a number line.
The decimal number 0.555... is between 0.5 and 0.6; so it is between  $\frac{1}{2}$ , or  $\frac{5}{10}$ , and  $\frac{6}{10}$ .
![image](images/ea64c0211801082ec8c97c2460481b51daa2fc4bade1529bd09f3e098ddf2a11.jpg)
Reasoning How do you know that the repeating decimal 0.555... can be written as a fraction?
Write the repeating decimal as a fraction.
Assign a variable to represent the repeating decimal.
Let  $x = 0.5$
$$
1 0 \cdot x = 1 0 \cdot 0. \overline {{5}}
$$
$$
1 0 x = 5. \overline {{5}}
$$
$$
1 0 x - x = 5. \overline {{5}} - 0. \overline {{5}}
$$
$$
9 x = 5
$$
$$
\frac {9 x}{9} = \frac {5}{9}
$$
$$
x = \frac {5}{9}
$$
The Sluggers won  $\frac{5}{9}$  of their games.
Because 0.5 has 1 repeating digit, multiply each side of the equation by  $10^{1}$ , or 10.
Subtract 0.5 from each side of the equation, then solve for  $x$ . Because  $x = 0.5$ , you can subtract  $x$  from one side and 0.5 from the other side.

Irrational
√11
5.636336333...
11 is not a perfect square, so  $\sqrt{11}$  is irrational.
The number 16 is a perfect square, so  $\sqrt{16} = 4$  is rational.
This decimal expansion does not repeat or terminate, so it is irrational.

$$
\begin{array}{l} 2 1 6 = s \cdot s \cdot s \\ 2 1 6 = s ^ {3} \\ \end{array}
$$
A number that is a cube of an integer is a perfect cube.
The number 216 is also a perfect cube.
To find the value of  $s$ , find the cube root of 216. The cube root of a number is a number whose cube is equal to that number.
The symbol  $\sqrt[3]{\cdot}$  means the cube root of a number.
$$
\begin{array}{l} \sqrt [ 3 ]{2 1 6} = \sqrt [ 3 ]{6 \cdot 6 \cdot 6} \\ = \sqrt [ 3 ]{6 ^ {3}} \\ = 6 \\ \end{array}
$$
Taking the cube root and cubing a number are inverse operations.
The dimensions of each square piece of wood are 6 inches by 6 inches.

Use the formula  $A = s^2$  to find each side length. To solve, take the square root of both sides of the equation.
$$
\begin{array}{l} A = s ^ {2} \\ 2 5 = s ^ {2} \\ \sqrt {2 5} = \sqrt {s ^ {2}} \\ \pm 5 = s \\ \end{array}
$$
Because  $5^{2} = 5 \times 5 = 25$
$$
\begin{array}{l} \text {a n d} (- 5) ^ {2} = - 5 \times - 5 = 2 5, \\ s = 5 \text {a n d} s = - 5, \text {o r} s = \pm 5. \\ \end{array}
$$
Since length is positive, each side length of the tabletop is 5 feet. Darius needs 20 feet of decorative molding.

### 703 (练习题)

**题目**: Kyle has a large, cube-shaped terrarium for his iguana. He wants to cover the opening with a square screen. What are the dimensions,  $s,$  for the screen?
$$
\begin{array}{l} V = s ^ {3} \\ 3 4 3 = s ^ {3} \\ \sqrt [ 3 ]{3 4 3} = \sqrt [ 3 ]{s ^ {3}} \\ 7 = s \\ \end{array}
$$
The value of s is not  $\pm \sqrt[3]{343}$  because
$$
\begin{array}{l} (- 7) ^ {3} = - 7 \times - 7 \times - 7 \\ = - 3 4 3. \\ \end{array}
$$
Each edge of the terrarium is 7 feet, so the dimensions of the screen are 7 feet by 7 feet.

Solve Equations Involving Imperfect Squares and Cubes
Solve for  $x$ .
A.  ${x}^{2} = {50}$
$$
\sqrt {x ^ {2}} = \sqrt {5 0}
$$
$$
x = \pm \sqrt {5 0}
$$
Because 50 is not a perfect square, write the solution using the square root symbol.
There are two possible solutions,  $x = +\sqrt{50}$  and  $x = -\sqrt{50}$ .
B.  $x^{3} = 37$
$$
\sqrt [ 3 ]{x ^ {3}} = \sqrt [ 3 ]{3 7}
$$
$$
x = \sqrt [ 3 ]{3 7}

$x = \sqrt[3]{37}$  is an exact solution of the equation.
There is one possible solution,  $x = \sqrt[3]{37}$ .

As the exponent decreases by one, the product is divided by 3.
$$
3 \div 3 = 1, \text {s o} 3 ^ {0} = 1.
$$
ANOTHER WAY Use the Quotient of Powers Property.
$$
\begin{array}{l} 3 ^ {3} \div 3 ^ {3} \\ = 3 ^ {3 - 3} = 3 ^ {0} \\ \end{array}
$$
When dividing two exponential expressions with the same base, subtract the exponents.
and
$$
\frac {3 ^ {3}}{3 ^ {3}} = \frac {3 \times 3 \times 3}{3 \times 3 \times 3} = 1
$$
so  $3^0 = 1$
The Zero Exponent Property states that  $a^0 = 1$  (assuming  $a \neq 0$ ).

Janelle is comparing the estimated populations of Japan and China. The estimated population of Japan is 126,818,019. The estimated population of China is shown. How can Janelle compare the two populations more easily?
Use Structure You can estimate large quantities and write them in a format that is easier to compare.
![image](images/f4f24fda13c90d2a0f9884626d6e8b0c70bff47046cfcc300e096740d59f9475.jpg)
STEP 1 Estimate each population by rounding to the greatest place value. Then write the number as a single digit times a power of 10.
Population of China
1,402,941,487
rounds to 1,000,000,000
$1 \times 10^{9}$
Count the zeros to determine the power of 10.
Population of Japan
126,818,019
rounds to 100,000,000
$1 \times 10^{8}$
STEP 2 Compare the estimated values.
$$
1 0 ^ {9} > 1 0 ^ {8}
$$
$$
1 \times 1 0 ^ {9} > 1 \times 1 0 ^ {8}
$$
Janelle can use estimates using powers of 10 to compare the populations more easily.

**解答**: Try It!
Light travels 299,792,458 meters per second. Sound travels at 332 meters per second. Use a power of 10 to compare the speed of light to the speed of sound.
299,792,458 rounded to the greatest place value
![image](images/bfd8e8f726ce1eee7149b83d64bc4481c6ac419238fff794be9be07b498b6be6.jpg)
There are zeros in the rounded number. The estimated speed of light
is  $\times 10$  meters per second.
$3\times 10 > 3\times 10$  so the speed of light is faster than the speed of sound.
Convince Me! Country A has a population of 1,238,682,005 and Country B has a population of 1,106,487,394. How would you compare these populations?

### EXAMPLE 3 (例题)

**题目**: EXAMPLE 3
Find How Many Times as Much
How does the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) of Canada compare to that of the United States?
STEP 1 Write each GDP as a single digit times a power of 10.
Canada: 1,785,387,000,000,000  $\approx$  2,000,000,000,000,000
$$
= 2 \times 1 0 ^ {1 5}
$$
USA: 17,348,075,000,000,000 ≈ 20,000,000,000,000,000
$$
= 2 \times 1 0 ^ {1 6}
$$
Count the zeros to determine the power of 10.
STEP 2 Compare the two estimates.
$$
(2 \times 1 0 ^ {1 6}) > (2 \times 1 0 ^ {1 5})
$$
The U.S. GDP is about 10 times greater than that of Canada.

Louisa is researching the approximate distance between Earth and the Sun. Her father told her that the distance is  $9.296 \times 10^{7}$  miles. In an astronomy book, she found the following.
Which distance is correct?

**解答**: Express both numbers in scientific notation.
STEP 2 Multiply.
$$
\begin{array}{l} (8. 2 \times 1 0 ^ {2}) \times (4. 3 \times 1 0 ^ {1}) \\ = (8. 2 \times 4. 3) \times (1 0 ^ {2} \times 1 0 ^ {1}) \\ = 3 5. 2 6 \times (1 0) ^ {2 + 1} \\ = 3 5. 2 6 \times 1 0 ^ {3} \\ = 3. 5 2 6 \times 1 0 ^ {4} \\ \end{array}
$$
Remember: The Product of Powers Property states that when multiplying powers with the same base, you add the exponents.
The first factor must be less than 10 and greater than or equal to 1.
The length of the main part of the bridge is approximately  $3.5 \times 10^{4}$  feet.

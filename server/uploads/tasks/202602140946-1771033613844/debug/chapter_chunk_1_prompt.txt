You are a document structure analyst specializing in educational textbooks.

## Task
Analyze the FULL TEXT of an educational document and identify ALL structural chapter/section headings.
Each line is a text block: [ID|pageNumber|optionalTypeTag] text

## CRITICAL: Table of Contents vs. Document Body
The first few pages may contain a TABLE OF CONTENTS (listing chapter names with page numbers).
You MUST IGNORE the actual Table of Contents lists.
HOWEVER, do NOT ignore "Front Matter" sections (like Introduction, Preface) or "Unit" title pages that appear before the main chapters.

Table of contents signs (IGNORE these):
- Pages explicitly labeled "Contents" or "Table of Contents"
- Lists of titles followed by page numbers (e.g., "1.1 ... 5", "Chapter 2 ... 12")
- Dense lists of headings on a single page

## What ARE Structural Headings (INCLUDE)
- **Front Matter**: Introduction, Preface, How to use this book, Acknowledgements, etc.
- **Back Matter**: Glossary, Index, Answers, etc.
- **Organization Containers**: Units, Modules, Parts, Themes (e.g., "Unit 1", "Module A")
- **Chapters**: (e.g., "Chapter 1", "1 Review of number concepts")
- **Sections**: (e.g., "1.1 Different types of numbers")
- **Sub-sections**: (e.g., "1.1.1", "Case Study")
- **Assessments**: "Past paper questions", "Project", "Review", "Summary"

## What Are NOT Headings (MUST EXCLUDE)
- The actual Table of Contents list itself
- Instructional labels: "Key points", "Tip", "Note", "Activity", "Exercise", "Q&A"
- Problem type labels: "Question 1", "Section A", "Multiple Choice"
- Running headers/footers (often repeated at top/bottom of pages)

## Hierarchy (Map to logical levels)
        - **Level 1**: Top-level containers.
          - Front Matter / Back Matter categories (e.g., "Front Matter", "Back Matter")
          - Units / Parts / Modules / Themes (e.g., "Unit 1", "Part A")
          - Standalone Chapters if no Units exist
        - **Level 2**: Main content divisions.
          - Chapters (if inside a Unit)
          - Sections (if inside a standalone Chapter)
          - Specific Front/Back Matter sections (e.g., "Introduction", "Foreword", "Glossary")
        - **Level 3**: Sub-divisions.
          - Sections (if inside a Unit->Chapter)
          - Sub-sections
          - Specific items like "1.1 Understanding units"
        - **Level 4**: Deep sub-divisions (if needed).
          - Sub-sections (e.g., "1.1.1")

        ## Fragmented Titles
If a heading is split across consecutive blocks (e.g., block 100="Chapter" + block 101="1"), merge them: output id as [100, 101].

## Completeness
- Include EVERY structural heading from the very beginning (Introduction) to the very end (Index).
- Do not skip "Unit" pages.

## Output Format
Return ONLY valid JSON:
{
  "directory": [
    {"id": <number or [n1, n2]>, "level": <1|2|3>, "title": "<heading text>"},
    ...
  ]
}
Array MUST be in the LOGICAL order of the document.

[314|p14|T1] GETTING STARTED
[315|p14] 1 A lot of the work in this chapter is revision. Look through the chapter to see what is covered.
[316|p14] a Are there any parts of this chapter that you could confidently skip? Explain why.
[317|p14] b If you only had to do three topics in this chapter, which would you choose? Why?
[318|p14] 2 Look at this completed cross-number puzzle.
[319|p14] a Write a set of clues for the puzzle. Each clue should include at least one of the concepts from this chapter.
[320|p14] b Find the sum of the three greatest numbers. Write the answer in words.
[321|p14] 3 Write each of the following using only numbers and brackets if needed.
[322|p14] a nine cubed
[323|p14] b twelve squared
[324|p14] c seven to the power of five
[325|p14] d the reciprocal of three to the power of two
[326|p14] e the reciprocal of three-quarters to the power of zero.
[327|p14] f nine to the power of half
[328|p14] g fourteen billion, ten thousand and nineteen
[329|p14] 4 Look at this decision diagram for problems involving calculation.
[330|p14] [Image]

[648|p22] Why do mathematicians find prime numbers exciting?
[649|p22] One reason why prime numbers are interesting and intriguing is because there is a lot about them that we don't know and that mathematicians have not been able to prove.
[650|p22] 1 Goldbach's conjecture (1742) is one of the oldest and best-known unsolved problems in number theory.
[651|p22] a What is Goldbach's strong conjecture?
[652|p22] b A Peruvian mathematician, Harald Helfgott, has published a largely accepted proof of Goldbach's weak conjecture. Find out more about this.

[668|p23] 5 Is 149 a prime number? Explain how you decided.
[669|p23|T1] Prime factors
[670|p23] Prime factors are the factors of a number that are also prime numbers.
[671|p23] Every composite whole number can be broken down and written as the product of its prime factors. You can do this using tree diagrams or using division. Both methods are shown in Worked example 5.
[672|p23|T1] TIP
[673|p23] Remember, a product is the answer to a multiplication. So to write a number as the product of its prime factors you write it like this:

[1032|p32] Brackets act as grouping symbols. Work out any calculations inside brackets before doing the calculations outside the brackets.
[1033|p32] Root signs work in the same way as a bracket. If you have [EQ] , you must add 25 and 9 before finding the root.

[1101|p34|T1] TIP
[1102|p34] Remember that anything raised to the power of zero is equal to 1.
[1103|p35|T1] The laws of indices
[1104|p35] The laws of indices are a set of mathematical rules that allow you to multiply and divide numbers written in index notation without having to write them in expanded form.
[1105|p35] Make sure that you remember these three important rules.
[1106|p35] To multiply different powers of the same number, add the indices. For example, [EQ] and [EQ] .
[1107|p35] To divide different powers of the same number, subtract the indices.
[1108|p35] For example, [EQ] and [EQ]
[1109|p35] To find the power of a power you multiply the indices. For example, [EQ] and [EQ]
[1110|p35] In general terms:
[1111|p35] [Equation]
[1112|p35|T1] Zero and negative indices
[1113|p35] Do you remember how to work with zero and negative indices? Read through this information to refresh your memory.
[1114|p35] In this table, each value is [EQ] of the one to its left. For example, [EQ] .
[1115|p35] [Table Row] <tr><td>Power of 5</td><td>54</td><td>53</td><td>52</td><td>51</td><td>50</td><td>5-1</td><td>5-2</td><td>5-3</td><td>5-4</td></tr>
[1116|p35] [Table Row] <tr><td>Value</td><td>625</td><td>125</td><td>25</td><td>5</td><td>1</td><td>1/5</td><td>1/25</td><td>1/125</td><td>1/625</td></tr>
[1117|p35] The pattern in the table shows that [EQ] . This is true for any number to the power of 0.
[1118|p35] We can say [EQ] (where [EQ] , because [EQ] is undefined.).
[1119|p35] You can also see from the table that a number with a negative index is equal to its reciprocal with a positive index. For example: [EQ] .
[1120|p35] This is true for all negative indices.
[1121|p35] We can say [EQ] (where [EQ] ).

[1201|p36] Fractional indices and roots are used in many different financial calculations involving investments, insurance policies and economic decisions.
[1202|p37] You can use the rule for finding the power of a power to show the meaning of fractional indices where the numerator is not 1 (non-unit fractions).
[1203|p37] [Equation]
[1204|p37] This shows that a number such as [EQ] can be written with a unit fraction index as [EQ] .

[1268|p38] do division and multiplication next, working from left to right.
[1269|p38] do addition and subtraction last, working from left to right.
[1270|p38] Many people use the letters BODMAS to remember the order of operations.
[1271|p38] The letters stand for:
[1272|p38] Brackets
[1273|p38] Orders
[1274|p38] Divide Multiply
[1275|p38] Add Subtract
[1276|p38] BODMAS indicates that indices (powers of) are considered after brackets but before all other operations.
[1277|p38|T1] Grouping symbols
[1278|p38] The most common grouping symbols in mathematics are brackets. Here are some examples of the different kinds of brackets used in mathematics:
[1279|p38] [Equation]
[1280|p38|T1] MATHEMATICAL CONNECTIONS
[1281|p38] You will apply the order of operation rules to fractions, decimals and algebraic expressions as you progress through the course.
[1282|p39] When you have more than one set of brackets in a calculation, you work out the innermost set first.
[1283|p39] Other symbols used to group operations are:
[1284|p39] - fraction bars, e.g. [EQ]
[1285|p39] - root signs, such as square roots and cube roots, e.g. [EQ]

[1793|p51|T1] GETTING STARTED
[1794|p51] 1 How do you write each of these using algebra? Choose A, B or C.
[1795|p51] a a×a
[1796|p51] A 2°
[1797|p51] B 2a
[1798|p51] C [EQ]
[1799|p51] b [EQ] multiplied by 5 and then added to 3.
[1800|p51] A [EQ]
[1801|p51] B [EQ]
[1802|p51] C [EQ]
[1803|p51] c x cubed and then multiplied by 3.
[1804|p51] A [EQ]
[1805|p51] B (3x)³
[1806|p51] C [EQ]
[1807|p51] 2 A class was asked to simplify four expressions containing indices. These are the answers:
[1808|p51] a 1

[1810|p51] a-m-n
[1811|p51] C
[1812|p51] a+
[1813|p51] d
[1814|p51] a
[1815|p51] Write an expression they could have simplified in each case.
[1816|p51] 3 These three examples contain some common mistakes that students make in algebra.
[1817|p51] [Table Row] <tr><td>Example 1 Removing brackets</td><td>Example 2 Multiplying fractions</td><td>Example 3 Simplifying fractions</td></tr>

[1831|p52|T1] 2.1 Using letters to represent unknown values
[1832|p52] In primary school you used empty shapes to represent unknown numbers. For example, [EQ] and [EQ] . If [EQ] , the [EQ] can only represent 6. But if [EQ] , then the [EQ] and the [EQ] can represent many ...
[1833|p52] Algebra uses letters to represent unknown numbers. You could write the number sentences above as: [EQ] and [EQ] . Number sentences like these are called equations. You can solve an equation by finding...
[1834|p52] When you worked with area of rectangles and triangles in the past, you used algebra to make a general rule, or formula, for working out the area, [EQ] :
[1835|p52] Area of a rectangle [EQ] length [EQ] width, so [EQ]
[1836|p52] Area of a triangle [EQ] base [EQ] height, so [EQ] or [EQ]
[1837|p52] When two letters are multiplied together, you write them next to each other, e.g. for [EQ] you would write [EQ] .
[1838|p52] To use a formula you have to replace some or all of the letters with numbers. This is called substitution.
[1839|p52|T1] Writing algebraic expressions
[1840|p52] An algebraic expression is a group of letters and numbers linked by operation signs. Each part of the expression is called a term.
[1841|p52] Suppose the average height (in centimetres) of students in your class is an unknown number, [EQ] . A student who is [EQ] taller than the average will have a height of [EQ] . A student who is [EQ] shor...
[1842|p52] [EQ] and [EQ] are algebraic expressions. Because the unknown value is represented by [EQ] , we say these are expressions in terms of [EQ] .
[1843|p52|T1] LINK
[1844|p52] Algebra is used across all science subjects. For example, in Biology algebra is used to model biochemical networks, and linear relationships such as heart rate (bpm) and cardiac output (how much blood...
[1845|p52|T1] TIP
[1846|p52] In an algebra problem, you must not change the 'case' of the letters being used. For example, 'n' and 'N' can represent different numbers in the same formula!
[1847|p53|T1] WORKED EXAMPLE 1
[1848|p53] Use algebra to write an expression in terms of [EQ] (which represents average height) for:
[1849|p53] a a height 12 cm shorter than average
[1850|p53] b a height 2a taller than average
[1851|p53] a height twice the average height
[1852|p53] d a height half the average height.
[1853|p53|T1] Answers
[1854|p53] a [EQ] Shorter than means less than, so you subtract.
[1855|p53] b [EQ] Taller than means more than, so you add. 2a is unknown, but it can still be used in the expression.
[1856|p53] [EQ] Twice means two times, so you multiply by two.
[1857|p53] d [EQ] Half means divided by two.
[1858|p53|T1] Applying the rules
[1859|p53] You should write algebraic expressions in the shortest, simplest possible way:
[1860|p53] [EQ] is written as [EQ] and [EQ] is written as [EQ]
[1861|p53] [EQ] means [EQ] , but you do not write the 1
[1862|p53] [EQ] is written as [EQ] and [EQ] is written as [EQ]
[1863|p53] - when you have the product of a number and a variable, the number is written first, so [EQ] and not [EQ] . Also, variables are normally written in alphabetical order, so [EQ] and [EQ] rather than [EQ...
[1864|p53] [EQ] is written as [EQ] (h squared) and [EQ] is written as [EQ] (h cubed). The [EQ] and the [EQ] are examples of a power or index
[1865|p53] the power only applies to the number or variable directly before it, so [EQ] means [EQ]
[1866|p53] - when a power is outside a bracket, it applies to everything inside the bracket, so [EQ] means [EQ] .
[1867|p53|T1] WORKED EXAMPLE 2
[1868|p53] Write expressions in terms of [EQ] to represent:
[1869|p53] a the number times four
[1870|p53] b the sum of the number and five

[1930|p54] 9 the fraction obtained when double the unknown number is divided by the sum of the unknown number and four.
[1931|p54|T1] TIP
[1932|p54] A 'sum' is the result of an addition and the 'difference' between two numbers is the result of a subtraction. The order of the subtraction matters.

[2102|p59|T1] DISCUSSION
[2103|p59] What is the point of algebra?
[2104|p59] Students sometimes ask why they have to learn algebra because they cannot see how it is useful.
[2105|p59] Work with a partner to prepare a short presentation to convince the rest of your class that algebra is valuable and useful.
[2106|p59] - Choose one of the topics in this chapter (or another algebra topic you like and know well).
[2107|p59] - Do research to find how this topic is useful in the real world.
[2108|p59] Prepare a slide show (or other presentation) to share what you find out. Include a description of the topic and how it is used. Provide at least three real-life examples.

[2111|p59|T1] 2.3 Simplifying expressions
[2112|p59] The parts of an algebraic expression are called terms. Terms are separated from each other by [EQ] or [EQ] signs. So [EQ] is an expression with two terms, but [EQ] is an expression with only one term ...
[2113|p59] The number in a term is called a coefficient. In the term [EQ] , the coefficient is 2; in the term [EQ] , the coefficient is [EQ] . A term with only numbers is called a constant. So for example, in th...
[2114|p59|T1] TIP
[2115|p59] Remember, terms are not separated by [EQ] or [EQ] signs. A fraction line means divide, so the parts of a fraction are all counted as one term, even if there is a [EQ] or [EQ] sign in the numerator or ...
[2116|p60|T1] Collecting like terms
[2117|p60] Terms with exactly the same variables are called like terms. [EQ] and [EQ] are like terms; [EQ] and [EQ] are like terms.
[2118|p60] The variables and any indices attached to them have to be identical for terms to be like terms, so [EQ] and [EQ] are like terms but [EQ] and [EQ] are not. Variables in a different order mean the same ...
[2119|p60] You can add and subtract like terms to simplify algebraic expressions. This is known as collecting like terms.

[2588|p69] When you write a number using indices (powers) you have written it in index notation. Any number can be used as an index including 0, negative integers and fractions.
[2589|p69] The index tells you how many times the base has been multiplied by itself. So:
[2590|p69] [Table Row] <tr><td>\( 3 \times 3 \times 3 \times 3 = {3}^{4} \)</td><td>3 is the base, 4 is the index</td></tr>
[2591|p69] [Table Row] <tr><td>\( a \times a \times a \times a \times a = {a}^{5} \)</td><td>\( a \) is the base, 5 is the index</td></tr>

[2966|p78|T1] SUMMARY
[2967|p78|T1] Do you know ...?
[2968|p78] Algebra has special conventions (rules) that allow you to write mathematical information in short ways.
[2969|p78] Letters in algebra are called variables, the number before a letter is called a coefficient and numbers on their own are called constants.
[2970|p78] A group of numbers and variables is called a term. Terms are separated by [EQ] and [EQ] signs, but not by [EQ] or [EQ] signs.
[2971|p78] Like terms have exactly the same combination of variables and powers. You can add and subtract like terms. You can multiply and divide like and unlike terms.
[2972|p78] The order of operations rules for numbers (BODMAS) apply in algebra as well.
[2973|p78] Removing brackets (multiplying out) is called expanding the expression. Collecting like terms is called simplifying the expression.
[2974|p78] Powers are also called indices. The index tells you how many times a number or variable is multiplied by itself. Indices only apply to the number or variable immediately before them.
[2975|p78] The laws of indices are a set of rules for simplifying expressions with indices. These laws apply to positive, negative, zero and fractional indices.
[2976|p79|T1] SUMMARY CONTINUED

[3193|p88] Angle ABC is [EQ]
[3194|p88|T1] TIP
[3195|p88] If the word reflex is not included you can assume you are dealing with the angle between the two arms (acute, right or obtuse).
[3196|p89] Method 1: Extend one arm of the angle to form a straight line (180° angle) and then measure the 'extra bit'. Add the 'extra bit' to 180° to get the total size.
[3197|p89] [Image]
[3198|p89] Extend [EQ] to point [EQ] . You know the angle of a straight line is [EQ] . So [EQ] .

[3204|p89] You can see that the angle [EQ] is almost [EQ] .

[3273|p91] 2 What hints can you give people to help them draw angles as accurately as possible?
[3274|p91|T1] Angle relationships
[3275|p91] Make sure you know the following angle facts:
[3276|p91] Complementary angles
[3277|p91] Angles in a right angle add up to [EQ] .
[3278|p92] When the sum of two angles is [EQ] those two angles are complementary angles.
[3279|p92] [Image]
[3280|p92] [Image]
[3281|p92|T1] Supplementary angles
[3282|p92] Angles on a straight line add up to [EQ] .
[3283|p92] When the sum of two angles is [EQ] those two angles are supplementary angles.
[3284|p92] [Image]
[3285|p92] [Image]
[3286|p92|T1] Angles round a point
[3287|p92] Angles at a point make a complete revolution.
[3288|p92] The sum of the angles at a point is [EQ]
[3289|p92] [Image]
[3290|p92] [Image]
[3291|p92] [Image]
[3292|p92|T1] Vertically opposite angles
[3293|p92] When two lines intersect, two pairs of vertically opposite angles are formed.
[3294|p92] Vertically opposite angles are equal in size.
[3295|p92] [Image]
[3296|p92] [Image]
[3297|p92] [Image]
[3298|p92|T1] TIP
[3299|p92] In general terms:
[3300|p92] For complementary angles, if one angle is [EQ] , the other must be [EQ] and vice versa.
[3301|p92] For supplementary angles, if one angle is [EQ] , the other must be [EQ] and vice versa.
[3302|p92|T1] TIP
[3303|p92] The adjacent angle pairs in vertically opposite angles form pairs of supplementary angles because they are also angles on a straight line.
[3304|p93|T1] Using angle relationships to find unknown angles
[3305|p93] You can use the relationships between angles to work out the size of unknown angles.
[3306|p93] To do this:
[3307|p93] identify the relationship
[3308|p93] make an equation
[3309|p93] - give reasons for statements
[3310|p93] - solve the equation to find the unknown value.

[3324|p93] You know that when two lines intersect, the resulting vertically opposite angles are equal. [EQ] and [EQ] are vertically opposite, so [EQ]
[3325|p93|T1] TIP
[3326|p93] In geometry problems you need to present your reasoning in a logical and structured way.

[3369|p95|T1] Angles and parallel lines
[3370|p95] When two parallel lines are cut by a third line (the transversal) eight angles are formed. These angles form pairs which are related to each other in specific ways.
[3371|p95|T1] Corresponding angles ( [EQ] -shape)
[3372|p95] When two parallel lines are cut by a transversal four pairs of corresponding angles are formed. Corresponding angles are equal to each other.

[3385|p95|T1] TIP
[3386|p95] Although [EQ] and [EQ] shapes help you to remember these properties, you must use the terms corresponding, 'alternate' and cointerior' to describe them when you answer a question.
[3387|p95|T1] MATHEMATICAL CONNECTIONS
[3388|p95] You will use the angle relationships in this section again when you deal with triangles, quadrilaterals, polygons and circles later in this chapter.

[3391|p95] Co-interior angles will only be equal if the transversal is perpendicular to the parallel lines (when they will both be [EQ] ).
[3392|p96] The angle relationships around parallel lines and the other angle relationships from earlier in the chapter are very useful for solving unknown angles in geometry.

[3458|p99|T1] Angle properties of triangles
[3459|p99] The three angles inside a triangle are called interior angles.
[3460|p99] If you extend a side of a triangle you make another angle outside the triangle. Angles outside the triangle are called exterior angles.
[3461|p99] Look at the following diagram carefully to see two important angle properties of triangles.

[3467|p99] - two interior angles of a triangle are equal to the opposite exterior angle.
[3468|p99] If you try this yourself with any triangle you will get the same results. But why is this so? Mathematicians cannot just show things to be true, they have to prove them using mathematical principles. ...

[3950|p121|T1] 4.1 Collecting and classifying data
[3951|p121] Data is a set of facts, numbers or other information. Statistics involves a process of collecting data and using it to try and answer a question. The flow diagram shows the four main steps involved in...

[3953|p121|T1] Different types of data
[3954|p121] Answer these two questions:
[3955|p121] Who is your favourite singer?
[3956|p121] How many people in your class wear glasses?
[3957|p121] Your answer to the first question will be the name of a person. Your answer to the second question will be a number. Both the name and the number are types of data.
[3958|p121] Categorical data is non-numerical data. It names or describes something without reference to number or size. Colours, names of people and places, yes and no answers, opinions and choices are all categ...
[3959|p121] Numerical data is data in number form. It can be an amount, a measurement, a time or a score. Numerical data is also called quantitative data (from the word quantity).
[3960|p121|T1] TIP
[3961|p121] Data is actually the plural of the Latin word datum, but in modern English the word data is accepted and used as a singular form, so you can talk about a set of data, this data, two items of data or a...
[3962|p121|T1] TIP
[3963|p121] The information that is stored on a computer hard-drive or your phone is also called data. In computer terms, data has nothing to do with statistics, it just means stored information.
[3964|p121|T1] LINK
[3965|p121] All of this work is very important in the fields of human and social sciences, where scientists need to present data to inform their conclusions.
[3966|p122] Numerical data can be further divided into two groups:
[3967|p122] - discrete data - this is data that can only take certain values, for example, the number of students in a class, goals scored in a match or red cars passing a point. When you count things, you are co...
[3968|p122] - continuous data - this is data that can take any value between two given values, for example, the height of a person who is between [EQ] and [EQ] tall could be [EQ] , [EQ] , [EQ] , [EQ] or any other...
[3969|p122|T1] TIP
[3970|p122] One way to decide if data is continuous is to ask whether it is possible for the values to be fractions or decimals. If the answer is yes, the data is usually continuous. But be careful:
[3971|p122] - age may seem to be discrete, because it is often given in full years, but it is actually continuous because we are getting older all the time
[3972|p122] - shoe sizes are discrete, even though you can get shoes in half sizes, because you don't get shoes in size [EQ] or [EQ] or [EQ] .
[3973|p122|T1] MATHEMATICAL CONNECTIONS
[3974|p122] You will need to fully understand continuous data when you study histograms in Chapter 20.
[3975|p122|T1] Methods of collecting data

[4019|p124|T1] Tally tables
[4020|p124] A tally table is used to keep a record when you count things.
[4021|p124|T1] TIP
[4022|p124] Remember each tally (I) shows one item. Tallies are grouped in fives (JH) to make it easier to get a total when you need one.
[4023|p124|T1] MATHEMATICAL CONNECTIONS
[4024|p124] You will use and extend these methods of organising data in later chapters. Make sure that you understand them now.
[4025|p124|T1] WORKED EXAMPLE 1

[4082|p126|T1] Frequency tables
[4083|p126] A frequency table shows the totals of the tally marks. Some frequency tables include the tallies.
[4084|p126] This frequency table shows the number of cars there were of each colour in a car park. It has a column for tallies and another column for the totals (frequencies) of the tallies.

[4173|p130|T1] WORKED EXAMPLE 2
[4174|p130] This data set shows the ages of customers in a café one lunchtime.

[4190|p130] [Table Row] <tr><td>5</td><td>5</td></tr>
[4191|p130] Group the ages in intervals of ten, 10-19; 20-29 and so on.
[4192|p130] These are two-digit numbers, so the tens digit is the stem.
[4193|p130] List the stems in ascending order down the left of the diagram.
[4194|p130] Work through the data in the order it is given, writing the units digits (the leaves) in a row next to the appropriate stem. Space the leaves to make them easier to read.
[4195|p130] If you need to work with the data, you can redraw the diagram, putting the leaves in ascending order.
[4196|p130] From this reorganised stem-and-leaf diagram you can quickly see that:
[4197|p130] the youngest person using the internet cafe was 17 years old (the first data item)
[4198|p130] the oldest person was 55 (the last data item)
[4199|p130] - most users were in the age group 30-39 (the group with the largest number of leaves).
[4200|p130] If you want to show two sets of data, you can use a back-to-back stem-and-leaf diagram. The second set of data is plotted against the same stem, but the leaves are written to the left.
[4201|p130] [Table Row] <tr><td>Brand X Leaf</td><td>Stem</td><td>Brand Y Leaf</td></tr>
[4202|p130] [Table Row] <tr><td>9 4 8 7 2</td><td>0</td><td>5 8</td></tr>

[4209|p130] [Table Row] <tr><td>Brand X 8 | 2 represents 28 hours Brand Y 4 | 2 represents 42 hours</td></tr>
[4210|p130] This stem-and-leaf diagram compares the battery life (between charges) of two different brands of mobile phone. You read the data for Brand X from right to left. The stem is still the tens digit.

[4247|p132|T1] Two-way tables
[4248|p132] A two-way table shows the frequency of certain results for two or more sets of data. Here is a two-way table showing how many people in cars were wearing their seat belts when they passed a check poin...
[4249|p132] [Table Row] <tr><td></td><td>Wearing a seat belt</td><td>Not wearing a seat belt</td></tr>

[4252|p132] The headings at the top of the table give you information about wearing seat belts. The headings down the side of the table give you information about drivers and passengers.
[4253|p133] You can use the table to find out:
[4254|p133] how many drivers were wearing seat belts
[4255|p133] how many passengers were wearing seat belts
[4256|p133] how many drivers were not wearing seat belts
[4257|p133] how many passengers were not wearing seat belts.
[4258|p133] You can also add the totals across and down to work out:
[4259|p133] how many drivers were surveyed
[4260|p133] how many passengers were surveyed
[4261|p133] - how many people (drivers and passengers) were wearing seat belts or not wearing seat belts.

[4410|p138] [Image]
[4411|p139] [Image]
[4412|p139] There are different methods of drawing bar charts, but all bar charts should have:
[4413|p139] a title that tells you what data is being displayed
[4414|p139] - a number scale or axis (so you can work out how many are in each class) and a label on the scale that tells you what the numbers stand for
[4415|p139] a scale or axis that lists the categories displayed
[4416|p139] - bars that are equally wide and equally spaced
[4417|p139] - bars that do not touch for qualitative of discrete data.

[4484|p143] 1 Work in small groups to write a checklist to assess whether someone can draw an accurate and clear bar chart.
[4485|p143] Consider the learning outcomes for this work and what you have covered in the lessons.
[4486|p143] - Your statements should be clear, specific and easy to check. For example: The chart has a clear heading [ ] yes [ ] no
[4487|p143] Leave space in your checklist to add comments. For example: Your heading has spelling mistakes in it. or The vertical scale needs to start at 0.
[4488|p143] 2 Use your checklist to assess another student's completed work in Exercise 4.8.

[4859|p162] A fraction tells you what share or part of a whole amount you are working with. For example, [EQ] of a pie means 1 of 2 equal parts of the pie and [EQ] of the students means 7 out of every 8 students....
[4860|p162] Proper fractions are written in the form [EQ] where [EQ] . The number on the top, [EQ] , can be any number and is called the numerator. The number on the bottom, [EQ] , can be any number except 0 and ...
[4861|p162] When you multiply or divide both the numerator and the denominator by the same number you get a new fraction that has the same value as the original fraction. The new fraction is called an equivalent ...
[4862|p162] For example, [EQ] and [EQ] .
[4863|p162] Notice in the second example that the original fraction [EQ] was divided rather than multiplied to get [EQ] . The numbers 5 and 7 have no common factor other than 1 so the fraction cannot be divided a...

[4939|p164] Multiply the numerators to get the new numerator value. Do the same with the denominators. Then express the fraction in its simplest form.
[4940|p164] Divide the denominator of the first fraction, and the numerator of the second fraction, by two.
[4941|p164] 15 and 7 do not have a common factor other than 1 and so cannot be simplified.
[4942|p164] You need to change the mixed number to an improper fraction. This allows you to complete the multiplication. Notice that the word 'of' is replaced with the [EQ] sign.

[5038|p166] You will revisit multiplication, division, addition and subtraction of fractions in Chapter 14 when you deal with algebraic fractions.
[5039|p167|T1] Dividing fractions
[5040|p167] To divide one fraction by another, you multiply the first fraction by the reciprocal of the second fraction.
[5041|p167] To find the reciprocal of a fraction you invert it. So, the reciprocal of [EQ] is [EQ] and the reciprocal of [EQ] is [EQ] .
[5042|p167] The reciprocal of [EQ] is [EQ] or just 2 and the reciprocal of 5 is [EQ] .
[5043|p167] When you multiply a fraction by its reciprocal the result is always 1. For example:
[5044|p167] [Equation]
[5045|p167] Look at the example below to understand why this method works.

[5586|p185|T1] Calculating in standard form without a calculator
[5587|p185] Sometimes you may have to perform calculations using numbers written in standard form without using your calculator.
[5588|p185|T1] Multiplying and dividing
[5589|p185] When numbers are written in standard form you can use the laws of indices to multiply and divide them without using a calculator.
[5590|p185|T1] MATHEMATICAL CONNECTIONS
[5591|p185] The laws of indices are covered in Chapter 1 and revisited in Chapter 2.

[5602|p185] Use the laws of indices where appropriate.
[5603|p185] Write the number in standard form.
[5604|p185] You may be asked to convert your answer to an ordinary number.

[5609|p185] [Equation]
[5610|p185] [Equation]
[5611|p185] The answer [EQ] is numerically correct but it is not in standard form because 16 is not between 1 and 10.

[5616|p186|T1] Adding and subtracting
[5617|p186] In Chapter 2 you learned that you can add and subtract like terms. In standard form, like terms are identical powers of 10. For example, [EQ] and [EQ] are like terms and you can add them to get [EQ] .
[5618|p186] The numbers [EQ] and [EQ] have different powers of 10, so these are not like terms and you cannot simply add them. Instead you can manipulate the expressions to make like terms. For example, you can w...
[5619|p186|T1] TIP
[5620|p186] If you are using a calculator you don't need to manipulate the expressions. You just enter the calculation correctly to get the answer.

[5683|p187|T1] REFLECTION
[5684|p187] Think about the work you have done on standard form.
[5685|p187] Did you find the examples clear and helpful? Explain why or why not.
[5686|p187] Which class activity helped you learn the most? Why?
[5687|p187] What do you think your teacher could have done differently to help you understand this work better?
[5688|p187|T1] TIP
[5689|p187] When using standard form with negative indices, the power to which 10 is raised tells you the position of the first non-zero digit after (to the right of) the decimal point.

[5977|p197] You have already learnt how to expand brackets to simplify expressions and solve equations. It can sometimes be helpful to carry out the opposite process and put brackets back into an algebraic expres...
[5978|p197] Consider the algebraic expression [EQ] . This expression is already simplified, but notice that 12 and 4 have a common factor. In fact the highest common factor (HCF) of 12 and 4 is 4.
[5979|p197] Now, [EQ] and [EQ] .
[5980|p197] So, [EQ]
[5981|p197] [Equation]
[5982|p197] Notice that the HCF has been 'taken out' of the bracket and written at the front. You find the terms inside by considering what you need to multiply by 4 to get [EQ] and [EQ] .
[5983|p197] The process of writing an algebraic expression using brackets in this way is called factorisation. The expression [EQ] has been factorised to give [EQ] .
[5984|p197] Worked example 3 shows some factorisations that are not quite so simple.

[6099|p200] [Equation]
[6100|p200] Sometimes it is more helpful to have a different variable as the subject so you need to know how to change the subject of a formula. In the formula [EQ] the subject is currently [EQ] , but you can cha...
[6101|p200] For example, to make [EQ] the subject of this formula:
[6102|p200] [EQ] Write down the starting formula.
[6103|p200] [EQ] Subtract [EQ] from both sides (to isolate the term containing [EQ]
[6104|p200] [EQ] Divide both sides by [EQ] (notice that everything on the left is divided by [EQ] ).
[6105|p200] You now have [EQ] on its own and so now [EQ] is the subject of the formula.
[6106|p200] Usually we rewrite this so the subject is on the left:

[6371|p213] You can find the circumference of a circle using formulae that uses either the radius or the diameter:
[6372|p213] Circumference [EQ] diameter
[6373|p213] [EQ] (where [EQ] diameter)
[6374|p213] [EQ] (where [EQ] radius)
[6375|p213|T1] Finding the area of a circle
[6376|p213] There is a simple formula for calculating the area of a circle. Here is a method that shows how you can work out the formula:
[6377|p213] Consider the circle shown in the diagram. It has been divided into 12 equal parts and these have been rearranged to give the diagram on the right.
[6378|p213] [Image]
[6379|p213] The parts of the circle are narrow, so the shape almost forms a rectangle with height equal to the radius of the circle and the length equal to half of the circumference.
[6380|p214] The formula for the area of a rectangle is area [EQ] , so:
[6381|p214] Area of a circle is approximately equal to
[6382|p214] [EQ] (Using the base and height shown in the diagram on the previous page.)
[6383|p214] [Equation]
[6384|p214] If you try this yourself by dividing a circle into a greater number of parts that are even narrower, you will notice that the right-hand diagram will look even more like a rectangle.
[6385|p214] This indicates (but does not prove) that the area of a circle is given by: [EQ] .
[6386|p214] You will now look at some examples so that you can see how to apply these formulae.
[6387|p214|T1] MATHEMATICAL CONNECTIONS

[6487|p218] The diagram shows a circle with two radii (plural of radius) drawn from the centre.
[6488|p218] The region contained in-between the two radii is known as a sector. Notice that there is a major sector and a minor sector.
[6489|p218] A section of the circumference is known as an arc.
[6490|p218] The Greek letter [EQ] represents the angle subtended at the centre. Notice that the minor sector is a fraction of the full circle. It is [EQ] of the circle.
[6491|p218] The area of a circle is [EQ] . The sector is [EQ] of the circle, so we can replace 'of' with '×' to give:
[6492|p218] Sector area = θ/360 × πr²
[6493|p218] [Image]
[6494|p219] The circumference of a circle is [EQ] . The sector is [EQ] of the circle, so the length of the arc of the sector is [EQ] of the circumference. So:
[6495|p219] Arc length = 360 × 2πr
[6496|p219] Make sure that you remember these two special cases:
[6497|p219] If [EQ] then you have a quarter of a circle.

[6572|p223|T1] 7.2 Three-dimensional objects
[6573|p223] The focus of the rest of this chapter is three-dimensional objects, but you will use many of the formulae for two-dimensional shapes in your calculations. A three-dimensional object is called a solid.
[6574|p223|T1] Nets of solids
[6575|p223] A net is a two-dimensional shape that can be drawn, cut out and folded to form a three-dimensional solid.
[6576|p223] This is the net of a solid that you should be quite familiar with.
[6577|p223] [Image]
[6578|p223] If you fold along the dotted lines and join the points with the same letters then you will form this cube.
[6579|p223] You should try this yourself and look carefully at which edges (sides) and which vertices (points or corners) join up.
[6580|p223] [Image]
[6581|p223|T1] TIP
[6582|p223] Cardboard boxes start out as a flat shape. The cardboard is then folded along carefully chosen lines, which become the edges of the box. Try unfolding a box to see how it was made.
[6583|p224|T1] Exercise 7.5
[6584|p224] 1 The diagram shows a cuboid. Draw a net for the cuboid.

[6587|p224] a Describe the solid in as much detail as you can.
[6588|p224] b Which two points will join with point [EQ] when the net is folded?
[6589|p224] c Which edges are equal in length to [EQ]
[6590|p224] [Image]

[6597|p224] 4 How could you make a cardboard model of this numbered octahedron? Draw labelled sketches to show your solution.
[6598|p224] [Image]

[6601|p225] a Find the surface area of the cuboid in [EQ]
[6602|p225] b Find the volume of the cuboid in [EQ]
[6603|p225|T1] 7.3 Surface areas and volumes of solids
[6604|p225] The flat, two-dimensional surfaces on the outside of a solid are called faces. You can find the area of each face using the techniques from earlier in this chapter. The total area of all the faces is ...
[6605|p225] The volume is the amount of space contained inside the solid. If the lengths are given in centimetres, then the volume is measured in cubic centimetres [EQ] and so on.
[6606|p225|T1] TIP
[6607|p225] We measure the amount of water flowing over a waterfall in cubic metres per second. The maximum flow of water over the Iguazu Falls in South America was 45700 cubic metres per second, on 9 June 2014. ...
[6608|p225|T1] TIP
[6609|p225] It can be helpful to draw the net of a solid when trying to find its surface area.
[6610|p225|T1] Cuboids
[6611|p225] A cuboid has six rectangular faces, twelve edges and eight vertices.
[6612|p225] If the length, width and height of the cuboid are [EQ] and [EQ] (respectively) then you can find the surface area by thinking about the areas of each rectangular face.
[6613|p225] [Image]
[6614|p226] Notice that the surface area is exactly the same as the area of the cuboid's net.
[6615|p226] Surface area of cuboid [EQ]
[6616|p226] [Image]
[6617|p226] The volume of a cuboid is its length [EQ] width [EQ] height.
[6618|p226] Volume of cuboid [EQ]
[6619|p226] [Image]
[6620|p226|T1] Prisms
[6621|p226] A prism is a solid whose cross-section is the same all along its length. (A cross-section is the surface formed when you cut parallel to a face.)
[6622|p226] [Image]
[6623|p226] Prisms are often named according to the shape of their cross-section. For example, a triangular prism has a triangle cross-section, a pentagonal prism has a pentagon cross-section and so on.
[6624|p227] A cuboid is a prism with a rectangular cross-section, so you may sometimes see it called a rectangular prism.
[6625|p227] [Image]
[6626|p227] [Image]
[6627|p227] You can calculate the surface area of a prism by working out the area of each face and adding them together. There are two ends with area equal to the cross-sectional area. The remaining sides are all...
[6628|p227] Surface area of a prism [EQ] area of cross-section + perimeter of cross-section [EQ] length
[6629|p227] You can calculate the volume of a prism by working out the area of the cross-section and multiplying this by the length.
[6630|p227] Volume of a prism [EQ] area of cross-section [EQ] length
[6631|p227|T1] Cylinders
[6632|p227] A cylinder is not a prism, because the cross section has curved edges. The cross section of a cylinder is a circle and is the same all along its length, so a cylinder is a 'tube'.
[6633|p227] [Image]
[6634|p227] [Image]
[6635|p227] A cylinder can be 'unwrapped' to produce its net. The surface of the solid consists of two circular faces and a curved surface that can be flattened to make a rectangle.
[6636|p227] Curved surface area of a cylinder [EQ]
[6637|p227] and
[6638|p227] Volume of a cylinder [EQ]
[6639|p227] [Image]
[6640|p227|T1] LINK
[6641|p227] Deep sea divers carry tanks filled with compressed air on their backs. These tanks are usually shaped like cylinders, making it easy to calculate the volume and to work out how much air is left.
[6642|p227|T1] TIP
[6643|p227] If questions ask for exact answers to surface area and volume calculations where [EQ] is part of the formula, you must give your answer as a multiple of [EQ] .
[6644|p228|T1] Exercise 7.6

[6670|p230] [Image]
[6671|p230|T1] Pyramids
[6672|p230] A pyramid is a solid with a polygon-shaped base and triangular faces that meet at a point called the apex.
[6673|p230] You can find the surface area of a pyramid by finding the area of the base and the area of each of the triangles and adding them all together.
[6674|p230] You can find the volume of a pyramid by using the following formula:
[6675|p230] Volume [EQ] base area [EQ] perpendicular height
[6676|p230] The perpendicular height is the shortest distance from the base to the apex.
[6677|p230|T1] Cones
[6678|p230] A cone is a not a pyramid, because it has a circular base and a curved surface. The length [EQ] is known as the slant height and [EQ] is the perpendicular height.
[6679|p230|T1] MATHEMATICAL CONNECTIONS
[6680|p230] The slant height can be calculated using Pythagoras' theorem, which you will meet in Chapter 11.
[6681|p230] The curved surface of the cone can be opened out and flattened to form a sector of a circle.
[6682|p230] Curved surface area of cone [EQ]
[6683|p230] If you are asked for the total surface area of a cone, you must work out the area of the circular base and add it to the curved surface area.
[6684|p230] [Image]
[6685|p230|T1] TIP
[6686|p230] In general, the perpendicular distance from a point to a line is the shortest distance to the line.
[6687|p230] [Image]
[6688|p231] You can calculate the volume of a cone using the following formula:

[6757|p235] Chapter 1 if you need some suggestions for sentence stems to get started.
[6758|p235|T1] SUMMARY
[6759|p235|T1] Do you know ...?
[6760|p235] The perimeter is the distance around the outside of a two-dimensional shape and the area is the space contained within the sides.
[6761|p235] Circumference is the name for the perimeter of a circle.
[6762|p235] If the units of length are given in cm then the units of area are cm² and the units of volume are cm³.
[6763|p235] This relationship is also true if the lengths are measured in mm, m, km and so on.
[6764|p235] A sector of a circle is the region contained in-between two radii of a circle. This splits the circle into a minor sector and a major sector.
[6765|p235] An arc is a section of the circumference.
[6766|p235] Prisms, pyramids, spheres, cubes and cuboids are examples of three-dimensional objects (or solids).
[6767|p235] A net is a two-dimensional shape that can be folded to form a solid.
[6768|p235] The net of a solid can be useful when working out the surface area of the solid.
[6769|p235|T1] Are you able to ...?

[6854|p241] Performing an experiment, such as rolling a dice, is called a trial. If you repeat an experiment, by carrying out a number of trials, you can find the experimental probability of an event happening. T...

[6866|p241|T1] TIP
[6867|p241] You can use fractions, decimals or percentages in probability, but fractions are often best (especially if the decimal is recurring). You should write fractions in their simplest form.
[6868|p241|T1] Relative frequency and expected occurrences
[6869|p241] You can use relative frequency work out how many times you expect something to occur over a large number of trials. For example, if you know that the relative frequency of rolling a four on particular...
[6870|p241|T1] MATHEMATICAL CONNECTIONS
[6871|p241] Remember that a percentage is a fraction with denominator of 100. If a probability is [EQ] , then it is [EQ] when written as a fraction.
[6872|p241|T1] TIP
[6873|p241] Experimental probability is an estimate of how likely something is. The more data you collect in your experiment, the more accurate your probability estimate will be.
[6874|p242] 18% of [EQ] and [EQ] of [EQ] , so if you rolled the same dice 80 times you would expect to get a four about 14 times and if you rolled it 200 times, you would expect to get a four 36 times.
[6875|p242] Remember though, that even if you expected to get a four 36 times, this is not guaranteed and your actual results may be very different.
[6876|p242|T1] Theoretical probability
[6877|p242] When you flip a coin you may be interested in the event 'getting a head' but this is only one possibility. When you flip a coin there are two possible outcomes: 'getting a head' or 'getting a tail.'
[6878|p242] If all the possible outcomes are equally likely, you can calculate the theoretical probability of an event by counting the number of favourable outcomes and dividing by the number of possible outcomes...
[6879|p242] Using the example from the start of the chapter, if you roll an unbiased dice and want to find the probability of getting an even number, then the favourable outcomes are two, four or six. There are s...
[6880|p242] If [EQ] is the event 'you get an even number', then:
[6881|p242] [Equation]
[6882|p242] [Image]
[6883|p242] Outcomes are equally likely because there is something about the experiment that makes them so. In the example of the dice, all of the faces on a fair dice are the same size and shape.
[6884|p242] Of course, a dice may be weighted in some way, or imperfectly made, and this can be true of any object discussed in a probability question. Under these circumstances a dice, coin or other object is sa...

[6886|p242] The numbers one to six are written on six identical cards. The cards are shuffled and placed face down on a table. If a card is selected at random, what is the probability of obtaining:
[6887|p242] a a three
[6888|p242] b an even number
[6889|p242] a prime number?
[6890|p242|T1] Answers
[6891|p242] a P(3) = 1/6
[6892|p242] There is only one way of picking a three, but six possible outcomes (you could select a 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6).
[6893|p242] b P(even number) = 3/6 = 1/2
[6894|p242] There are three ways of picking an even number, giving three favourable outcomes.
[6895|p242] c [EQ]
[6896|p242] The prime numbers you could pick are 2, 3 and 5, giving three favourable outcomes.
[6897|p242|T1] TIP
[6898|p242] In some countries, theoretical probability is referred to as 'expected probability'. This is a casual reference and does not mean the same thing as mathematical 'expectation'.
[6899|p242|T1] TIP
[6900|p242] Questions will usually tell you whether an object or experiment is unbiased.

[6934|p244|T1] The probability that an event does not happen
[6935|p244] Something may happen or it may not happen. The probability that an event happens will usually be different from the probability that the event does not happen, but the two combined probabilities will ...
[6936|p244] If [EQ] is an event, then [EQ] is the event that [EQ] does not happen and [EQ] .
[6937|p244|T1] TIP
[6938|p244] When you talk about [EQ] you usually refer to it as not [EQ] Sometimes you may see A used instead of [EQ]

[6942|p244] [Equation]
[6943|p244|T1] TIP
[6944|p244] When the probability of an event happens is equal to the probability the event does not happen, both probabilities must be equal to [EQ] . This probability is sometimes referred to as 'evens'.

[6946|p244|T1] Talking about probability
[6947|p244] Many people try to use probability terms, but don't fully understand the statement they are making. How would you explain what is wrong with each of the following statements?
[6948|p244] 1 In a 'true or false' quiz with ten questions, you are certain to get five right if you guess.
[6949|p244] 2 In a rowing race a team can win, lose or draw, so the probability they win is [EQ] .
[6950|p244] 3 If you roll a dice ten times and get four sixes, the dice must be biased.
[6951|p244] 4 There are 16 red socks and 24 blue socks in a drawer. If you pull ten socks out of the drawer there will always be more blue socks than red socks.
[6952|p244] 5 The sign by the ice cream stall says that the probability of rain today is [EQ] , but it is raining, so the probability it rains today must have always been 1.
[6953|p244|T1] Exercise 8.1
[6954|p244] 1 A six-sided dice is thrown 100 times and the number five appears 14 times.
[6955|p244] a Find the experimental probability of throwing a five, giving your answer as a fraction in its lowest terms.
[6956|p244] b Write your answer to part (a) as a percentage.
[6957|p244|T1] TIP
[6958|p244] Probabilities are most often given as decimals or fractions, but you can also use percentages. For example, you can write a probability of [EQ] as [EQ] or a probability of 0.32 as [EQ] .

[8592|p249|T1] PEER ASSESSMENT
[8593|p249] 1 Work with a partner. Look at the sample space diagrams your partner has drawn in Exercise 8.2.
[8594|p249] 2 Use the following criteria to assess each other's sample space diagrams. Highlight any problematic areas and provide corrections or suggestions for improving the diagram.
[8595|p249|T1] Criteria:
[8596|p249] All possible outcomes are correctly indicated.
[8597|p249] The diagram is easy to read and interpret.
[8598|p249] You can find the probability of different events easily.
[8599|p250|T1] REFLECTION
[8600|p250] Sometimes giving students marks and asking them to do corrections does not help them to improve their mathematical understanding. It can be more useful for the person marking the work to write one or ...
[8601|p250] Have you checked that all the possible outcomes are shown?
[8602|p250] Did you draw a clear diagram?
[8603|p250] How do you think someone asking questions could help you to overcome difficulties and understand the work better?
[8604|p250|T1] 8.3 Combining independent and mutually exclusive events
[8605|p250] Sometimes you will need to calculate the probability that two events happen, one after the other. You might also need to calculate the probability that either of two events happen. In this section you...
[8606|p250|T1] Independent events
[8607|p250] If you flip an unbiased coin once, the probability of it showing a head is 0.5. Whatever happened the first time, if you flip the coin a second time the probability of it showing a head will still be ...
[8608|p250] Imagine you have a bag containing different coloured balls. If you choose a ball, note its colour, replace it and then choose another, the choice of the first ball does not influence the choice of the...
[8609|p250|T1] MATHEMATICAL CONNECTIONS
[8610|p250] If you do not replace the first ball the events will not be independent. There is one ball less for the second choice so the probabilities will have changed. You will think about situations like this ...
[8611|p250] You can calculate the probability that two independent events, [EQ] and [EQ] , both occur:
[8612|p250] [EQ] happens and then [EQ] happens) [EQ]
[8613|p250] or
[8614|p250] [EQ] and [EQ]
[8615|p250] For example, when flipping two coins,
[8616|p250] P(flipping two heads) = P(Heads) × P(Heads) = 1/2 × 1/2 = 1/4
[8617|p250|T1] TIP
[8618|p250] Note that this formula is only true if [EQ] and [EQ] are independent.
[8619|p251|T1] Mutually exclusive events
[8620|p251] If you throw a normal dice and let:
[8621|p251] [Equation]
[8622|p251] and
[8623|p251] [Equation]
[8624|p251] then [EQ] and [EQ] cannot happen together because no number is both even and odd at the same time. You can say that [EQ] and [EQ] are mutually exclusive events.

[8626|p251] When you throw a dice, the events 'get an even number' and 'get a number less than four' are not mutually exclusive because if you throw a two, both events occur at the same time. You will learn more ...
[8627|p251] For two mutually exclusive events [EQ] and [EQ] , you can calculate the probability that either [EQ] or [EQ] occurs:
[8628|p251] [Equation]
[8629|p251] For example, when rolling a normal dice,
[8630|p251] For example, when the number of odd numbers is [EQ]
[8631|p251] Worked examples 8 and 9 demonstrate how you can use these simple formulae for independent and mutually exclusive events.
[8632|p251|T1] TIP
[8633|p251] Note, this formula only works if A and B are mutually exclusive.
[8634|p251|T1] WORKED EXAMPLE 8
[8635|p251] Noa and Sunja are both taking a music examination independently.
[8636|p251] The probability that Noa passes is [EQ] and the probability that Sunja passes is [EQ] .
[8637|p251] What is the probability that:
[8638|p251] a both pass?
[8639|p251] b neither passes?
[8640|p251] at least one passes?
[8641|p251] either Noa or Sunja passes (but not both)?
[8642|p251|T1] Answers
[8643|p251] a [EQ]
[8644|p251] The outcomes are independent so use the formula:
[8645|p251] [Equation]
[8646|p251] [Equation]
[8647|p251] b [EQ] (neither passes) [EQ] (Noa fails and Sunja fails
[8648|p251] [Equation]
[8649|p252|T1] WORKED EXAMPLE 8 CONTINUED
[8650|p252] c [EQ] (at least one passes) [EQ] (neither passes)
[8651|p252] [Equation]
[8652|p252] d P(either Sunja or Noa passes)
[8653|p252] [EQ]
[8654|p252] or Noa fails and Sunja passes)
[8655|p252] [Equation]
[8656|p252] 'Noa passes and Sunja fails' and, 'Noa fails and Sunja passes,' are mutually exclusive because they cannot both happen at the same time. So use the formula:
[8657|p252] [EQ] or [EQ] , where
[8658|p252] A = Noa passes and Sunja fails
[8659|p252] and
[8660|p252] [EQ] Noa fails and Sunja passes.
[8661|p252|T1] TIP
[8662|p252] It is not possible to pass and fail an exam at the same time. This is why the events are mutually exclusive.

[8714|p254] Why was this difficult for you to understand?
[8715|p254|T1] SUMMARY
[8716|p254|T1] Do you know ...?
[8717|p254] Probability measures how likely something is to happen.
[8718|p254] An outcome is the single result of an experiment.
[8719|p254] An event is a collection of favourable outcomes.
[8720|p254] Experimental probability can be calculated by dividing the number of favourable outcomes by the number of trials.
[8721|p254] Favourable outcomes are any outcomes that mean your event has happened.
[8722|p254] If outcomes are equally likely then theoretical probability can be calculated by dividing the number of favourable outcomes by the number of possible outcomes.
[8723|p254] The probability of an event happening and the probability of that event not happening will always sum up to one. If [EQ] is an event, then [EQ] is the event that [EQ] does not happen and [EQ] .
[8724|p254] Independent events do not affect one another.
[8725|p254] Mutually exclusive events cannot happen together.
[8726|p254|T1] Are you able to ...?
[8727|p254] find an experimental probability given the results of several trials
[8728|p254] find a theoretical probability
[8729|p254] find the probability that an event will not happen if you know the probability that it will happen.

[8986|p266|T1] 9.1 Sequences
[8987|p266] A sequence is set of numbers (or a pattern) that follow a particular order. Each number in a sequence is called a term. Terms that follow each other in a sequence are called consecutive terms.
[8988|p266] The position of a term is given using [EQ] so [EQ] is the first term, [EQ] is the fifth term and [EQ] is any term.
[8989|p266] The terms in a sequence usually follow a rule. You can use the rule for a sequence to work out which term comes next or the value of any term in the sequence.
[8990|p266] There are different kinds of sequences.
[8991|p266] Arithmetic sequences have a common (constant) difference between the terms. For example, the sequence 2, 6, 10, 14, ... has a common difference of +4 and the sequence 100, 92, 84, 76, ... has a common...
[8992|p266] Non-linear sequences do not have a common difference between the terms.
[8993|p266] Geometric sequences involve multiplying or dividing by a common ratio. For example, each term in the sequence 3, 6, 12, 24, ... is found by multiplying the previous term by 2 and the sequence 800, 400...
[8994|p266] Some sequences involve powers:
[8995|p266] quadratic sequences involve square numbers. For example, 1, 4, 9, 16, ...
[8996|p266] cubic sequences involve cube numbers. For example, 1, 8, 27, 64, ...
[8997|p266|T1] The term-to-term rule
[8998|p266] Here are some sequences with the rule that tells you how to keep the sequence going:
[8999|p266] 2, 8, 14, 20, 26, 32, ... (get the next term by adding six to the previous term).
[9000|p266] You can show this pattern by drawing it in this way:
[9001|p266] [Image]
[9002|p266] 1, [EQ] (divide each term by two to get the next term).
[9003|p266] This diagram shows how the sequence progresses:
[9004|p266] [Image]
[9005|p266] 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, ... (multiply each term by two to get the next term).

[9028|p267] 3 The first term [EQ] of a sequence is 5. The term-to-term rule for the sequence is 'add [EQ] '.
[9029|p267] Find the value of [EQ] that will give you each of these sequences:
[9030|p267] a every second term is not an integer
[9031|p267] b every second term is a multiple of 10.
[9032|p267] c [EQ]
[9033|p267|T1] Relating a term to its position in the sequence
[9034|p267] The term-to-term rule is useful for finding the next few terms in a sequence. However, if you are asked to find the 20th term or the 100th term it is not efficient to list all the terms. If you can wo...
[9035|p267] To find the rule you have to work systematically with the term number and the value of each term. Tables are very useful for doing this.
[9036|p267] This table shows the term number and the value of the first five terms in a sequence.
[9037|p267] [Table Row] <tr><td>Term number (n)</td><td>1</td><td>2</td><td>3</td><td>4</td><td>5</td></tr>
[9038|p267] [Table Row] <tr><td>Term</td><td>5</td><td>8</td><td>11</td><td>14</td><td>17</td></tr>
[9039|p267] You can see that the difference between the terms is 3. This tells you something about the algebraic rule.
[9040|p267] If you multiply each term number [EQ] by 3, you get:
[9041|p267] [Table Row] <tr><td>Term number (n)</td><td>1</td><td>2</td><td>3</td><td>4</td><td>5</td></tr>
[9042|p267] [Table Row] <tr><td>Term</td><td>5</td><td>8</td><td>11</td><td>14</td><td>17</td></tr>
[9043|p267] [Table Row] <tr><td>3 × n</td><td>3</td><td>6</td><td>9</td><td>12</td><td>15</td></tr>
[9044|p268] By comparing the value of each term with the value of [EQ] , you can see that the term is 2 more than [EQ] each time.
[9045|p268] This means that each term is [EQ] or [EQ] .
[9046|p268] This is called a position-to-term rule.
[9047|p268] An expression for the term in position [EQ] is called the [EQ] th term (or general term). So for this sequence the [EQ] th term [EQ] .
[9048|p268] Notice that the common difference between each term in the sequence is the value that is multiplying [EQ] (the coefficient of [EQ] ) in the [EQ] th term rule. This happens with any sequence for which ...
[9049|p268] You can use this rule to find the term in any position by substituting the value of [EQ] into the rule. For example:
[9050|p268] the 45th term [EQ]
[9051|p268] the 90th term [EQ]

[9059|p268] a
[9060|p268] [Image]
[9061|p268] The common difference between terms is [EQ] , so [EQ] will appear in the rule. Make a table to show the position of each term and include the values for [EQ] .
[9062|p268] [Table Row] <tr><td>n</td><td>1</td><td>2</td><td>3</td><td>4</td><td>5</td><td>6</td></tr>

[9064|p268] [Table Row] <tr><td>4n</td><td>4</td><td>8</td><td>12</td><td>16</td><td>20</td><td>24</td></tr>
[9065|p268] Each term is 2 less than [EQ] , so the rule for the nth term is [EQ] .
[9066|p268] b 40th term [EQ]
[9067|p268] To find the 40th term in the sequence substitute
[9068|p268] [Equation]
[9069|p268] [EQ] into the nth term formula.
[9070|p268] c [EQ]
[9071|p268] If the number 50 is in the sequence there must be a value of [EQ] for which [EQ] . Rearrange the rule to make [EQ] the subject.
[9072|p268] [Equation]
[9073|p268] [Equation]
[9074|p268] [Equation]
[9075|p268] Add 2 to both sides.
[9076|p268] Divide both sides by 4.
[9077|p269|T1] WORKED EXAMPLE 1 CONTINUED
[9078|p269] Since this has given a whole number, 50 must be the [EQ] term in the sequence.
[9079|p269] d [EQ]
[9080|p269] If the number 125 is in the sequence then there must be a value of [EQ] for which [EQ] . Rearrange to make [EQ] the subject.
[9081|p269] [Equation]
[9082|p269] Add 2 to both sides.
[9083|p269] [Equation]
[9084|p269] Divide both sides by 4.
[9085|p269] Since [EQ] is the position in the sequence it must be a whole number and it is not in this case. This means that 125 cannot be a number in the sequence.
[9086|p269|T1] TIP
[9087|p269] There are other ways of knowing that 125 is not in the sequence. For example, you can see that [EQ] is always an even number, but 125 is odd, so it cannot appear in the sequence. It is important, thou...

[9091|p269|T1] Answer
[9092|p269] Work out the difference between terms in the sequence. This is known as the first difference.
[9093|p269] [Image]
[9094|p269] The first difference is not constant so work out the second difference:
[9095|p269] [Image]
[9096|p269] The second difference is constant. This means the sequence is quadratic and the rule will involve [EQ] .
[9097|p269|T1] TIP
[9098|p269] You may recognise that the numbers in this sequence are all 1 greater than the sequence of square numbers and be able to answer the question by inspection.
[9099|p270|T1] WORKED EXAMPLE 2 CONTINUED
[9100|p270] Make a table to show the position of each term and include a row for the values of [EQ] .

[9102|p270] [Table Row] <tr><td>Term</td><td>2</td><td>5</td><td>10</td><td>17</td><td>26</td></tr>
[9103|p270] [Table Row] <tr><td>n2</td><td>1</td><td>4</td><td>9</td><td>16</td><td>25</td></tr>
[9104|p270] Each term is 1 greater than the value of [EQ] , so the [EQ] th term is [EQ] .
[9105|p270] All quadratic sequences have a constant second difference.
[9106|p270] If the sequence is cubic it will have a constant third difference and the rule for the sequence will involve [EQ] .
[9107|p270] The general term of a quadratic sequence is in the form [EQ] .
[9108|p270] This table shows the first four terms in the general sequence and their first and second differences.
[9109|p270] [Table Row] <tr><td>n</td><td>1</td><td>2</td><td>3</td><td>4</td></tr>

[9112|p270] [Table Row] <tr><td>2nd difference</td><td>2a</td><td>2a</td><td></td><td></td></tr>
[9113|p270] The table shows that for any quadratic sequence:
[9114|p270] the 1st term is [EQ]
[9115|p270] the 2nd term minus the 1st term [EQ] is [EQ]
[9116|p270] the 2nd difference is [EQ]
[9117|p270] This gives us a way to work out the general term for complex quadratic sequences.

[9135|p271] Consider the sequence 20, 100, 500, 2500 ...
[9136|p271] You find each term by multiplying the previous term by 5. This type of sequence is called an exponential sequence and expression for the [EQ] th term will involve an exponent (in terms of [EQ] ).
[9137|p271] Listing the terms can help you find the rule:
[9138|p271] T2 20×5
[9139|p271] T3 20×5×5=20×5²
[9140|p271] T 20×5×5×5=20×5
[9141|p271] You can see that for each term the exponent is one less than the term number.
[9142|p271] So for the nth term, the exponent will be [EQ] :
[9143|p271] T 20×5n-1

[9912|p296|T1] 9.4 Sets
[9913|p296] A set is a list or collection of objects that share one or more characteristics. The objects in a set can be anything from numbers, letters and shapes to names, places or paintings, but there is usual...
[9914|p296] The list of members or elements of a set is placed inside a pair of curly brackets [EQ] .
[9915|p296] Some examples of sets are:
[9916|p296] {2,4,6,8,10} - the set of all even integers greater than zero but less than 11
[9917|p296] [EQ] - the set of vowels
[9918|p296] {Red, Green, Blue} - the set containing the colours red, green and blue.
[9919|p296] We use capital letters to name sets:
[9920|p296] If [EQ] is the set of prime numbers less than 10, then: [EQ] .
[9921|p296] If [EQ] is the set of letters in the word 'HAPPY', then: [EQ] .
[9922|p296] Two sets are equal if they contain exactly the same elements, even if the order is different, so:
[9923|p296] [EQ] and so on.
[9924|p296] The number of elements in a set is written as [EQ] , where [EQ] is the name of the set. For example, in the set [EQ] there are five elements so [EQ] .
[9925|p296] A set that contains no elements is known as the empty set. The symbol [EQ] is used to represent the empty set.
[9926|p296] For example:
[9927|p296] {odd numbers that are multiples of two} = [EQ] because no odd number is a multiple of two.
[9928|p296] Now, if [EQ] is a member (an element) of the set [EQ] then it is written: [EQ] .
[9929|p296] If [EQ] is not a member of the set [EQ] , then it is written: [EQ] .
[9930|p296] For example, if [EQ] , then:
[9931|p296] Spades [EQ] but Turtles [EQ]
[9932|p296] Some sets have a number of elements that can be counted. These are known as finite sets. If there is no limit to the number of members of a set then the set is infinite.
[9933|p296] If [EQ] , then [EQ] has 26 members and is finite.
[9934|p296] If [EQ] , then [EQ] and is infinite.
[9935|p296] So, to summarise:
[9936|p296] - sets are listed inside curly brackets { }
[9937|p296] - [EQ] means it is an empty set.
[9938|p296] [EQ] means [EQ] is an element of the set [EQ]
[9939|p296] - [EQ] means [EQ] is not an element of the set [EQ] .
[9940|p296] - [EQ] is the number of elements in set [EQ] .

[9942|p296] Sets are often used in advanced probability theory.
[9943|p296|T1] TIP
[9944|p296] Remember the curly brackets on either side when you list a set.
[9945|p296|T1] TIP
[9946|p296] Notice, for set [EQ] , that elements of a set are not repeated.

[9985|p297|T1] Universal sets
[9986|p297] The following sets all have a number of things in common:
[9987|p297] [Equation]
[9988|p297] [Equation]
[9989|p297] [Equation]
[9990|p297] All three are contained within the set of whole numbers. They are also all contained in the set of integers less than 22.
[9991|p297] When you work with sets there is usually a 'largest' set which contains all of the sets that you are studying. This set can change according to the problem you are trying to solve.
[9992|p297] Here, the set of integers contains all elements from [EQ] or [EQ] . But then so does the set of all positive integers less than 22.
[9993|p298] Both these sets (and many more) can be used as a universal set. A universal set contains all possible elements that you would consider for a set in a particular problem. The symbol [EQ] is used to mea...
[9994|p298|T1] Complements
[9995|p298] The complement of the set [EQ] is the set of all things that are in [EQ] but NOT in the set [EQ] . The symbol [EQ] is used to denote the complement of set [EQ] .
[9996|p298] For example, if [EQ] and [EQ]
[9997|p298] then the complement of [EQ] would be [EQ] .
[9998|p298] So, in summary:
[9999|p298] [EQ] represents a universal set
[10000|p298] [EQ] represents the complement of set [EQ]
[10001|p298|T1] Unions and intersections
[10002|p298] The union of two sets, [EQ] and [EQ] , is the set of all elements that are members of [EQ] or members of [EQ] or members of both. The symbol [EQ] is used to indicate union so, the union of sets [EQ] a...
[10003|p298] [EQ]
[10004|p298] The intersection of two sets, [EQ] and [EQ] , is the set of all elements that are members of both [EQ] and [EQ] . The symbol [EQ] is used to indicate intersection so, the intersection of sets [EQ] and...
[10005|p298] A∩B
[10006|p298] For example, if [EQ] and [EQ] , then:
[10007|p298] [EQ] the set of all elements common to both [EQ]
[10008|p298] [EQ] the set of all elements that are in [EQ] or [EQ] or both [EQ]
[10009|p298|T1] Subsets
[10010|p298] You already know that a rectangle is a type of quadrilateral and that all rectangles are quadrilaterals. If set [EQ] is the set of all quadrilaterals and set [EQ] is the set of all rectangles, then ev...
[10011|p298] You can reverse the [EQ] symbol, but this does not change its meaning. [EQ] means [EQ] is a subset of [EQ] , but so does [EQ] . If [EQ] is not a subset of [EQ] , you write [EQ] .
[10012|p298] So in summary:
[10013|p298] [EQ] is the symbol for union
[10014|p298] - [EQ] is the symbol for intersection
[10015|p298] - [EQ] indicates that [EQ] is a subset of [EQ] .
[10016|p298] - [EQ] indicates that [EQ] is not a subset of [EQ] .
[10017|p298|T1] TIP
[10018|p298] Taking the union of two sets is like adding the sets together but remember you do not repeat elements within the set.
[10019|p298|T1] TIP
[10020|p298] The symbol, [EQ] has a open end and a closed end. The subset goes at the closed end.

[10148|p304|T1] Set builder notation
[10149|p304] So far, the contents of a set have either been given as a list of the elements or described by a rule (in words) that defines whether or not something is a member of the set. We can also describe sets...
[10150|p304] For example:
[10151|p304] [EQ] isanaturalnumber}
[10152|p304] This means:
[10153|p304] [Image]
[10154|p304] In other words, this is the set: [EQ] .
[10155|p304] Sometimes the set builder notation contains restrictions.
[10156|p304] For example, [EQ] .
[10157|p304] In this case, set [EQ] .
[10158|p304] Here is another example:
[10159|p304] [EQ] integers greater than zero but less than 20\}
[10160|p304] In set builder notation this is:
[10161|p304] [EQ] is an integer, [EQ]
[10162|p305] This is read as: 'A is the set of all [EQ] such that [EQ] is an integer and [EQ] is greater than zero but less than [EQ] '.
[10163|p305] The following examples show how this notation is used.
[10164|p305|T1] WORKED EXAMPLE 21
[10165|p305] List the members of the set [EQ] if [EQ] .
[10166|p305|T1] Answer
[10167|p305] Read the set as: 'C is the set of all x'such that x is a member of the set of primes and x is greater than 10 but less than 20'.
[10168|p305] The prime numbers greater than 10 but less than 20 are 11, 13, 17 and 19.
[10169|p305] So, [EQ]
[10170|p305|T1] WORKED EXAMPLE 22
[10171|p305] Express the following set in set builder notation:
[10172|p305] [EQ] (right-angled triangles)
[10173|p305|T1] Answer
[10174|p305] So, [EQ] If [EQ] is the set of all right-angled triangles, then [EQ] has a right-angle [EQ] is the set of all [EQ] such that [EQ] is a triangle and [EQ] is right-angled.
[10175|p305] As you can see from this last example, set builder notation can sometimes force you to write more, but this isn't always the case, as you will see in the following exercise.

[10203|p306|T1] TIP
[10204|p306] Set builder notation is very useful when it isn't possible to list all the members of set because the set is infinite. For example, all the numbers less than -3 or all whole numbers greater than 1000.
[10205|p306|T1] SUMMARY
[10206|p306|T1] Do you know...?
[10207|p306] A sequence is the elements of a set arranged in a particular order, connected by a rule.
[10208|p306] A term is any number in a sequence.
[10209|p306] If the position of a term in a sequence is given the letter [EQ] then a rule can be found to work out the value of the [EQ] th term.
[10210|p306] A rational number is a number that can be written as a fraction.
[10211|p306] An irrational number cannot be written as a fraction and will have a decimal part that continues forever without repeating.
[10212|p306] Sunds are exact values of irrational numbers written with a root sign.
[10213|p306] A surd is in simplest form when it has no factors that are square numbers and when the denominator of a fraction with surds is a rational number.
[10214|p306] A set is a list or collection of objects that share a characteristic.
[10215|p306] An element is a member of a set.
[10216|p306] A set that contains no elements is called the empty set (2).
[10217|p306] A universal set [EQ] contains all the possible elements appropriate to a particular problem.
[10218|p306] The complement of a set is the elements that are not in the set [EQ]
[10219|p306] The elements of two sets can be combined (without repeats) to form the union of the two sets [EQ] .
[10220|p306] The elements that two sets have in common is called the intersection of the two sets [EQ] .
[10221|p306] A Venn diagram is a pictorial method of showing sets.
[10222|p306] A shorthand way of describing the elements of a set is called set builder notation.

[10333|p312|T1] GETTING STARTED
[10334|p312] 1 A table of values gives a set of ordered pairs [EQ] that you can use to plot graphs on a coordinate grid.
[10335|p312] [Table Row] <tr><td>x</td><td>-1</td><td>0</td><td>1</td><td>2</td></tr>
[10336|p312] [Table Row] <tr><td>y</td><td>3</td><td>4</td><td>5</td><td>6</td></tr>
[10337|p312] Plot these points and draw a line through them.
[10338|p312] 2 The standard equation of a straight line graph is [EQ] .
[10339|p312] - [EQ] is the gradient (or steepness) of the graph.
[10340|p312] - c is the point where the graph crosses the y-axis (the y-intercept).
[10341|p312] a What is the relationship between the x- and y-values in the table in question 1?
[10342|p312] b What equation could you use to describe the line you get when you plot the points?
[10343|p312] 3 Look at the graph. Calculate the gradient, find the [EQ] -intercept and use these to write the equation of the straight line.

[10357|p312|T1] Using equations to plot lines
[10358|p312] Keely owns a boat hire company. If Keely charges an initial fee of [EQ]15 per hour, you can find a formula for the total cost $y after a hire time of x hours.
[10359|p312] Total cost [EQ] initial fee [EQ] total charge for all hours
[10360|p312] [Equation]
[10361|p312] or (rearranging)
[10362|p312] [Equation]
[10363|p313] Now think about the total cost for a range of different hire times:
[10364|p313] one hour: cost = 15 × 1 + 40 = $55
[10365|p313] two hours: cost = 15 × 2 + 40 = $70
[10366|p313] three hours: cost = 15 × 3 + 40 = $85
[10367|p313] and so on.
[10368|p313] If you put these values (and some more) into a table you can then plot a graph of the total cost against the number of hire hours:
[10369|p313] [Table Row] <tr><td>Number of hours (x)</td><td>1</td><td>2</td><td>3</td><td>4</td><td>5</td><td>6</td><td>7</td><td>8</td><td>9</td></tr>
[10370|p313] [Table Row] <tr><td>Total cost (y)</td><td>55</td><td>70</td><td>85</td><td>100</td><td>115</td><td>130</td><td>145</td><td>160</td><td>175</td></tr>
[10371|p313] [Image]
[10372|p313] The graph shows the total cost of the boat hire (plotted on the vertical axis) against the number of hire hours (on the horizontal axis). Notice that the points all lie on a straight line.
[10373|p313] The formula [EQ] tells you how the [EQ] -coordinates of all points on the line are related to the [EQ] -coordinates. This formula is called an equation of the line.
[10374|p313|T1] MATHEMATICAL CONNECTIONS
[10375|p313] You will recognise that some of the formulae used to describe nth terms in Chapter 9 are very similar to the equations used in this chapter.
[10376|p313] The following worked examples show you how some more lines can be drawn from given equations.
[10377|p314|T1] WORKED EXAMPLE 1
[10378|p314] A straight line has equation [EQ] . Construct a table of values for [EQ] and [EQ] and draw the line on a labelled pair of axes. Use integer values of [EQ] from -3 to 2.
[10379|p314|T1] Answer
[10380|p314] Substituting the values [EQ] and 2 into the equation gives the values in the following table:
[10381|p314] [Table Row] <tr><td>x</td><td>-3</td><td>-2</td><td>-1</td><td>0</td><td>1</td><td>2</td></tr>
[10382|p314] [Table Row] <tr><td>y</td><td>-3</td><td>-1</td><td>1</td><td>3</td><td>5</td><td>7</td></tr>
[10383|p314] Notice that the [EQ] -values range from [EQ] to [EQ] , so your [EQ] -axis should allow for this.
[10384|p314] [Image]
[10385|p314|T1] WORKED EXAMPLE 2
[10386|p314] Draw the line with equation [EQ] for [EQ] -values from -2 to 5.
[10387|p314|T1] Answer
[10388|p314] The table for this line is:
[10389|p314] [Table Row] <tr><td>x</td><td>-2</td><td>-1</td><td>0</td><td>1</td><td>2</td><td>3</td><td>4</td><td>5</td></tr>
[10390|p314] [Table Row] <tr><td>y</td><td>5</td><td>4</td><td>3</td><td>2</td><td>1</td><td>0</td><td>-1</td><td>-2</td></tr>
[10391|p314] [Image]
[10392|p314] To draw a graph from its equation:
[10393|p314] - construct a table of values and fill in the [EQ] - and [EQ] -coordinates of at least three points (although you may be given more)
[10394|p314] - draw and label your set of axes for the range of [EQ] -values you have worked out.
[10395|p314] - plot each point on the number plane
[10396|p314] - draw a straight line to join the points (use a ruler).
[10397|p314|T1] TIP
[10398|p314] Before drawing your axes, always check that you know the range of y-values that you need to use.

[10439|p316] Every point on the vertical line has [EQ] -coordinate [EQ] . So the equation of the line is simply [EQ] .
[10440|p316] Every point on the horizontal line has [EQ] -coordinate [EQ] . So the equation of this line is [EQ] .
[10441|p316] All vertical lines are of the form: [EQ] a number.
[10442|p316] All horizontal lines are of the form: [EQ] a number.
[10443|p316] The gradient of a vertical line is undefined because the graph does not move right or left.
[10444|p316] The gradient of a horizontal line is zero (it does not move up or down when you move to the right).

[10446|p316|T1] LINK

[10464|p317] The gradient of a line measures how steep the line is. You calculate it by dividing the change in the [EQ] -coordinate by the increase in the [EQ] -coordinate:
[10465|p317] Gradient [EQ]
[10466|p317] For graph (a): the [EQ] -change is 8 and the [EQ] -change is 2, so the gradient is [EQ] .
[10467|p317] For graph (b): the [EQ] -change is [EQ] (negative because you need to move down to return to the line) and the [EQ] -change is 4, so the gradient is [EQ] .
[10468|p317] It is essential that you think about [EQ] -changes only. Whether the [EQ] -change is positive or negative tells you what the sign of the gradient will be.
[10469|p317|T1] MATHEMATICAL CONNECTIONS

[10844|p332] The diagram shows a rectangle of width [EQ] cm and length [EQ] cm that has been divided into smaller rectangles.
[10845|p332] The area of the whole rectangle is equal to the sum of the smaller areas, so the area of whole rectangle [EQ] .
[10846|p332] The sum of smaller rectangle areas: [EQ] .
[10847|p332] This means that [EQ] and this is true for all values of [EQ] .

[10850|p332] Notice that the four terms in boxes are exactly the same as the four smaller areas that were calculated before.
[10851|p332] Another way to show this calculation is to use a grid:

[11198|p340|T1] Using factors to solve quadratic equations
[11199|p340] You can now use the factorisation method to solve some quadratic equations A quadratic equation is an equation of the form [EQ] . The method is illustrated in Worked example 17.
[11200|p340|T1] WORKED EXAMPLE 17
[11201|p340] Solve each of the following equations for [EQ] .
[11202|p340] a [EQ]
[11203|p340] b [EQ]
[11204|p340] [EQ]
[11205|p340] d [EQ]
[11206|p340|T1] Answers
[11207|p340] a [EQ]
[11208|p340] [Equation]
[11209|p340] Now the key point:
[11210|p340] If two or more quantities multiply to give zero, then at least one of the quantities must be zero.
[11211|p340] So either [EQ] or [EQ] .
[11212|p340] Check: [EQ] (this works).
[11213|p340] [EQ] (this also works)
[11214|p340] In fact both [EQ] and [EQ] are solutions.
[11215|p340] b [EQ]
[11216|p340] [Equation]
[11217|p340] Therefore either [EQ] .
[11218|p340] [Equation]
[11219|p340] Again, there are two possible values of [EQ] .
[11220|p340] Notice that both terms of the left-hand side are multiples of [EQ] so you can take out a common factor of [EQ] .
[11221|p340] Use the factorisation method of Worked example 14 on the left-hand side of the equation.
[11222|p340|T1] TIP
[11223|p340] Where the numbers are not square, try taking a common factor out first.
[11224|p340|T1] TIP
[11225|p340] When you solve quadratic equations, you should rearrange them so that a zero appears on one side, i.e. so that they are in the form [EQ]
[11226|p340|T1] TIP
[11227|p340] There are still two solutions here, but they are identical. When a quadratic equation has solutions, there are always two of them, even if they are both the same!

[11230|p341] [EQ]
[11231|p341] [EQ] (subtract 12 from both sides)
[11232|p341] Factorising, you get [EQ]
[11233|p341] So either [EQ] .
[11234|p341] or [EQ]
[11235|p341] d Factorise [EQ]
[11236|p341] to give [EQ]
[11237|p341] So either [EQ] .
[11238|p341] or [EQ]
[11239|p341] Of course these are both the same thing, so the only solution is [EQ] .
[11240|p341] When you rearrange some equations with fractions you get quadratic expressions and you may have to factorise those find the solutions.
[11241|p341|T1] WORKED EXAMPLE 18
[11242|p341] Solve the equation [EQ]
[11243|p341] [Equation]
[11244|p341] Multiply both sides by [EQ]
[11245|p341] [Equation]
[11246|p341] Expand the brackets. Note there is now a term with [EQ] .
[11247|p341] [Equation]
[11248|p341] Subtract 8x from both sides.
[11249|p341] [Equation]
[11250|p341] Subtract 24 from both sides.
[11251|p341] [Equation]
[11252|p341] Factorise the quadratic expression.

[11423|p348] Centuries before Pythagoras was alive, the Egyptians knew that if they tied knots in a rope at regular intervals, as in the diagram, they would produce a perfect right angle.
[11424|p348] If you are given a right-angled triangle and asked to calculate the length of an unknown side, you can do this using Pythagoras' theorem if you know the lengths of the other two sides.

[11801|p365|T1] Similar solids
[11802|p365] Three-dimensional shapes (solids) can also be similar.
[11803|p365] Similar solids have the same shape, their corresponding angles are equal and all corresponding linear measures (edges, diameters, radii, heights and slant heights) are in the same ratio. As with simil...
[11804|p365] Volume and surface area of similar solids
[11805|p365] [Image]
[11806|p366] The following table shows the side length and volume of each of these cubes.
[11807|p366] [Image]
[11808|p366] Notice that when the side length is multiplied by 2 the volume is multiplied by [EQ] .
[11809|p366] Here, the scale factor of lengths is 2 and the scale factor of volumes is [EQ] .
[11810|p366] Also, when the side length is multiplied by 5 the volume is multiplied by [EQ] .
[11811|p366] This time the scale factor of lengths is 5 and the scale factor of volumes is [EQ] .
[11812|p366] In fact, this pattern is true in the general case:
[11813|p366] Scale factor of volumes [EQ] (scale factor of lengths)
[11814|p366] By considering the surface areas of the cubes you can also see that the rule about the scale factor of areas is still true:
[11815|p366] Scale factor of areas [EQ] (scale factor of lengths)²
[11816|p366] In summary, if two solids [EQ] and [EQ] ) are similar:
[11817|p366] the ratio of their volumes is equal to the cube of the ratio of corresponding lengths (edges, diameter, radii, heights and slant heights). In other words: [EQ] where [EQ] and [EQ] are corresponding le...
[11818|p366] the ratio of their surface areas is equal to the square of the ratio of corresponding linear measures. In other words: [EQ]
[11819|p366] The following worked examples show how you can use these scale factors.

[11907|p371] Two shapes are congruent if they are the same shape and size.
[11908|p371|T1] MATHEMATICAL CONNECTIONS
[11909|p371] You will meet rotations and reflections in Chapter 19. When an object is reflected or rotated its shape and size remain unchanged. The resulting object is congruent to the original.
[11910|p371] If two shapes are congruent then:
[11911|p371] corresponding sides are equal in length.
[11912|p371] corresponding angles are equal
[11913|p371] the shapes have the same area.
[11914|p371] Look at these pairs of congruent shapes. The corresponding sides and angles on each shape are marked using the same colours and symbols.

[11978|p374] The longest side of a right-angled triangle is called the hypotenuse.
[11979|p374] The square of the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the squares of the two shorter sides of the triangle.
[11980|p374] Similar shapes have equal corresponding angles and the ratios of corresponding sides are equal.
[11981|p374] If shapes are similar and the lengths of one shape are multiplied by a scale factor of [EQ] :
[11982|p374] then the areas are multiplied by a scale factor of [EQ]

[12066|p378] 47667486811686356764
[12067|p378] How would you describe the shape sizes in this class?
[12068|p378] Sometimes you might want to represent a set of data with a single value. When you do this, you use an average value.
[12069|p378] There are three main types of average used in statistics and you can use each of them to describe the shoe sizes for the class.
[12070|p378] The is the value that occurs the most often. If you count how times each shoe size occurs in the class, you will find that the most common (most frequent) size is six, so in this example the mode is 6...

[12082|p378] There is more than one "average", so you should never refer to the average.
[12083|p378] Always specify which average you are talking about: the mean, median or mode.
[12084|p379] Another average is the mean. This is the value you get when you add up all the shoe sizes and divide your answer by the number of students:
[12085|p379] [Equation]
[12086|p379] The mean value tells you that the shoe sizes appear to be distributed in some way around the value 6.05. It also gives you a good impression of the general 'size' of the data. Notice that the value of...
[12087|p379] The third average is called the median. The median is the middle value when data is arranged in ascending order. So, putting the shoe sizes in order from smallest to largest gives:
[12088|p379] [Table Row] <tr><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>5</td><td>6</td><td>6</td><td>6</td><td>6</td><td>6</td><td>7</td><td>7</td><td>7</td><td>8</td><td>8</td><td>8</td><td>11</td></t...
[12089|p379] To find the middle number you can think of the first and last values as one pair and cross them off. Then continue crossing off pairs until you are left with a single value in the middle.

[12091|p379] For these shoe sizes, the median value is 6.
[12092|p379] Crossing off numbers from each end can be difficult if you have a lot of data. If you count from the left, you find that the median is the 10th value. Adding one to the number of students and dividing...
[12093|p379] But what if there had been 20 students in the class? For example, if there is an extra student with a shoe size of 11. Crossing off pairs gives this result:

[12095|p379] You are left with a middle pair rather than a single value. If this happens then you need to find the mean of this middle pair: [EQ] .
[12096|p379] Notice that the position of the first value in this middle pair is [EQ] . If you have an even number of data values, dividing the number by two will always give you the first value of the middle pair.
[12097|p379] In summary:
[12098|p379] Mode The value that appears in the list more than any other. There can be more than one mode but if there are no values that occur more often than any other then there is no mode.
[12099|p379] Mean The value when you calculate total of all data number of values The mean may not be one of the actual data values.
[12100|p379] Median 1 Arrange the data into ascending numerical order.
[12101|p379] 2 If the number of data is [EQ] and [EQ] is odd, find [EQ] . This will give you the position of the median.
[12102|p379] 3 If [EQ] is even, then calculate [EQ] . This will give you the position of the first of the middle pair. Find the mean of this pair.
[12103|p379|T1] TIP
[12104|p379] If you take the mean of [EQ] items and multiply it by [EQ] , you get the total of all [EQ] values.
[12105|p379] The mean is sometimes referred to as a measure of 'central tendency' of the data.

[12107|p380] Many people use averages in their work. Geographers use them to summarise numerical results for large populations, so they don't have to show every piece of numerical data they collect.

[12111|p380|T1] Dealing with extreme values
[12112|p380] Sometimes your set of data may contain values that are extreme in some way. For example, if you measure the speeds of cars passing a certain point you may find that some cars are moving unusually slow...
[12113|p380] Imagine these are the speeds (in kilometres per hour) of six cars passing a certain point in a five-minute period:
[12114|p380] 67.2 58.3 128.9 65.0 49.0 55.7
[12115|p380] The value [EQ] seems much faster than any other car. How does this extreme value affect your averages?
[12116|p380] You can check yourself that the mean of the above data including the extreme value is [EQ]
[12117|p380] This average is larger than all but one of the values and is not representative of the data. This means that in this situation the mean might be a poor choice of average. If you discover that the high...
[12118|p380] If the extreme value is genuine and you cannot exclude it, then using the median is a better way to represent the main body of data. Start by writing the data in ascending order:
[12119|p380] 49.0 55.7 58.3 65.0 67.2 128.9
[12120|p380] The median is the mean of 58.3 and 65.0. This is 61.7. Notice that if you remove the highest value, the median reduces to 58.3, so this doesn't change things very much.
[12121|p380] There is no mode for these data.
[12122|p380|T1] TIP
[12123|p380] The number of data values is even, so the median is the mean of the 3rd and 4th data points.

[12171|p382|T1] 12.2 Making comparisons using averages and ranges
[12172|p382] Now you know how to find an average value to represent your data, you can compare two or more sets of data. However, just comparing the averages can sometimes be misleading.
[12173|p382] It can also be helpful to know how consistent the data is. You do this by thinking about how scattered – or spread – the values are. A simple measure of spread is the range.
[12174|p382] Range = largest value - smallest value

[12176|p382] Think about whether the player will choose an average that helps them claim they are a good player or an average that is a fair representation of their scores.

[12384|p391|T1] 12.4 Estimating the mean and finding the modal class for grouped data
[12385|p391|T1] MATHEMATICAL CONNECTIONS
[12386|p391] You learnt about discrete, continuous and grouped data in Chapter 4 and you used inequality notation to define the groups. You may find it helpful to review that work before continuing.
[12387|p391|T1] LINK
[12388|p391] Real-world data can involve thousands of data points, so it is clear that grouping data, rather than recording a list of exact values is sensible.
[12389|p391] When a government carries out a national census to collect numerical data about the population, the questions asked often involve ranges of ages, salaries and so on. It is not practical to record the ...
[12390|p391] When data is grouped in a frequency table you do not have the actual data points, so you have to work with the classes to estimate the mean and mode.
[12391|p391] The following worked example shows how a grouped frequency table is used to find the estimated mean and the modal class
[12392|p392|T1] WORKED EXAMPLE 4

[12400|p392] Find:
[12401|p392] a an estimate for the mean height of the children
[12402|p392] b the modal class.
[12403|p392|T1] Answers

[12405|p392] Halfway between [EQ] and [EQ] is [EQ] .
[12406|p392] A good estimate of the total height of the 12 children in this class is [EQ] (frequency [EQ] midpoint).
[12407|p392] Extend your table to include midpoints and totals for each class:
[12408|p392] [Table Row] <tr><td>Height in cm (h)</td><td>Frequency (f)</td><td>Midpoint (x)</td><td>Frequency x midpoint (fx)</td></tr>
[12409|p392] [Table Row] <tr><td>120 &lt; h ≤ 130</td><td>12</td><td>125</td><td>12 × 125 = 1500</td></tr>
[12410|p392] [Table Row] <tr><td>130 &lt; h ≤ 140</td><td>16</td><td>135</td><td>16 × 135 = 2160</td></tr>

[12414|p392] An estimate for the mean height of the children is:
[12415|p392] [Equation]
[12416|p392] b The class with the highest frequency is the modal class. In this case it is the class: [EQ] .

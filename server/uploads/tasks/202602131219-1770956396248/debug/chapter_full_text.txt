[155|p6] Statistics are often rounded. Here, the decimal 0.555... or 0.5 is rounded to the thousandths place.
[157|p6] Locate 0.555... on a number line.
[158|p6] The decimal number 0.555... is between 0.5 and 0.6; so it is between  $\frac{1}{2}$ , or  $\frac{5}{10}$ , and  $\frac{6}{10}$ .
[160|p6] Reasoning How do you know that the repeating decimal 0.555... can be written as a fraction?
[161|p6] Write the repeating decimal as a fraction.
[162|p6] Assign a variable to represent the repeating decimal.
[163|p6] Let  $x = 0.5$
[164|p6] $$
1 0 \cdot x = 1 0 \cdot 0. \overline {{5}}
$$
[165|p6] $$
1 0 x = 5. \overline {{5}}
$$
[166|p6] $$
1 0 x - x = 5. \overline {{5}} - 0. \overline {{5}}
$$
[167|p6] $$
9 x = 5
$$
[168|p6] $$
\frac {9 x}{9} = \frac {5}{9}
$$
[169|p6] $$
x = \frac {5}{9}
$$
[170|p6] The Sluggers won  $\frac{5}{9}$  of their games.
[171|p6] Because 0.5 has 1 repeating digit, multiply each side of the equation by  $10^{1}$ , or 10.
[172|p6] Subtract 0.5 from each side of the equation, then solve for  $x$ . Because  $x = 0.5$ , you can subtract  $x$  from one side and 0.5 from the other si...

[180|p7] Sabine entered a division expression into her calculator. The quotient is shown on the calculator screen. What expression could Sabine have entered?
[182|p7] Let  $x = 0.26$
[183|p7] ${10x} = 2.\overline{6}$
[184|p7] Multiply by  $10^{1}$ , or 10, because the decimal has 1 repeating digit.
[185|p7] $$
1 0 x - x = 2. \overline {{6}} - 0. 2 \overline {{6}}
$$
[186|p7] Subtract  $0.26$  from each side of the equation, and then solve for  $x$ . Because  $x = 0.26$ , you can subtract  $x$  from one side and  $0.26$  fr...
[187|p7] $$
9 x = 2. 4
$$
[188|p7] $$
\frac {9 x}{9} = \frac {2 . 4}{9}
$$
[189|p7] $$
x = \frac {2 4}{9 0}
$$
[190|p7] Write an equivalent fraction so that the numerator and denominator are integers.
[191|p7] Sabine could have entered  $24 \div 90$ , or an equivalent expression such as  $8 \div 30$ .

[198|p7] Write 2.09 as a mixed number.
[199|p7] Let  $x = 2.09$
[200|p7] ${100} \cdot  x = {100} \cdot  {2.09}$
[201|p7] $$
1 0 0 x - x = 2 0 9. \overline {{0 9}} - 2. \overline {{0 9}}
$$
[202|p7] $$
9 9 x = 2 0 7
$$
[203|p7] $$
x = \frac {2 0 7}{9 9} \text {o r} 2 \frac {1}{1 1}
$$
[204|p7] The repeating decimal has 2 repeating digits, so multiply each side of the equation by  $10^{2}$ , or 100.
[205|p7] Subtract  $x$  from one side of the equation and its equivalent 2.09 from the other side of the equation.

[212|p8] STEP 2 Write an equation: variable  $=$  decimal.
[213|p8] STEP 3 Multiply each side of the equation by  $10^{d}$ , where  $d$  is the number of repeating digits in the repeating decimal.

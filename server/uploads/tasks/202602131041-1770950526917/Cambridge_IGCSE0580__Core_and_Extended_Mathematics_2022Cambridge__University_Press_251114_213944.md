# > Introduction

We have completely revised and updated the material to support the revised Cambridge IGCSE™ and IGCSE (9-1) Mathematics syllabuses (0580/0980) for examination from 2025. As in previous editions, both Core and Extended topics are fully covered so that the book continues to offer a valuable resource for students and teachers. If you are following the Extended syllabus, you should also ensure you learn the Core content as you need to know this too. If you are following the Core syllabus, you can see the Extended material and use it if you are interested but you do not need to know this.

# So, what is new?

Besides the updated content and fresh new design, we have increased the number of real-life applications and links to other subjects. You'll find these throughout the course.

To align with modern thinking about maths and maths teaching, and to develop problem-solving skills, we have added open-ended and open-middle problems, investigations and projects that encourage communication and collaboration around maths concepts and build thinking and reasoning into lessons.

We've increased the number of practice questions at the end of each chapter and updated the past paper questions that we have included so that you get many chances to apply your skills and make connections between different areas of mathematics as you work through structured and integrated problems.

In line with modern thinking about how people learn best, we've built in opportunities for different types of self- and peer- assessment. The feedback from these assessments will help you decide what revision or practice you can do to improve your understanding and/or performance.

There are also many opportunities for you to reflect on your own learning and to think about what you can do really well and to consider what you can learn from your mistakes. The reflection questions aim to encourage a growth mindset and develop positive attitudes towards learning maths.

We hope that you will enjoy working through the course and that you will find the material interesting, engaging and worthwhile.

Karen Morrison and Nick Hamshaw

The statue shown in the photograph is a replica of a 22 000-year-old bone found in the Congo Basin. The real bone is only  $10\mathrm{cm}$  long and it is carved with groups of notches that represent numbers. One column lists the prime numbers from 10 to 20. It is one of the earliest examples of a number system using tallies. What do you think ancient civilisations used tallies for?

Our modern number system is called the Hindu-Arabic system because it was developed by Hindus and spread by Arab traders who brought it with them when they moved to different places in the world. The Hindu-Arabic system is decimal. This means it uses place value based on powers of ten. Any number at all, including decimals and fractions, can be written using place value and the digits from 0 to 9.

The set of real numbers is made up of rational numbers and irrational numbers

Rational numbers can be written as fractions in the form  $\frac{a}{b}$  where  $a$  and  $b$  are non-zero integers. The set of rational numbers includes all integers, all fractions, all terminating decimals and all recurring decimals.

Irrational numbers cannot be written as fractions. The set of irrational numbers consists of non-terminating, non-recurring decimals. The square root of a non-square number (such as  $\sqrt{2}$ ), the cube root of a non-cube number (such as  $\sqrt[3]{12}$ ) and  $\pi$  are all irrational numbers.

# TIP

Find the product means multiply. So, the product of 3 and 4 is 12, i.e.  $3 \times 4 = 12$ .

# MATHEMATICAL CONNECTIONS

You will deal with rational and irrational numbers in more detail in Chapter 9.

# LINK

Some numbers, for example  $\sqrt{-1}$  and other roots of negative numbers, are not real numbers. They are neither rational nor irrational. Mathematicians call these imaginary numbers and you may learn about them if you study maths beyond Cambridge IGCSE.

# Exercise 1.1

1 Here is a set of numbers:  $\{-4, -1, 0, \frac{1}{2}, 0.75, 3, 4, 6, 11, 16, 19, 25\}$

List the numbers from this set that are:

a natural numbers

b even numbers

c odd numbers

d integers

negative integers

f fractions

9 square numbers

h prime numbers

neither square nor prime.

2 List:

a the next four odd numbers after 107  
b four consecutive even numbers between 2008 and 2030  
c all odd numbers between 993 and 1007  
d the first five square numbers  
e four decimal fractions that are smaller than 0.5  
f four common fractions that are greater than  $\frac{1}{2}$  but smaller than  $\frac{3}{4}$

3 State whether the following will be odd or even.

a the sum of two odd numbers  
b the sum of two even numbers  
c the sum of an odd and an even number  
d the square of an odd number  
the square of an even number  
f an odd number multiplied by an even number

4 There are many other types of numbers. Find out what these numbers are and give an example of each.

a Perfect numbers  
b Palindromic numbers  
c Narcissistic numbers (in other words, numbers that love themselves!)

# MATHEMATICAL CONNECTIONS

You will learn much more about sets in Chapter 9. For now, just think of a set as a list of numbers or other items that are often placed inside curly brackets.

# TIP

Remember that a 'sum' is the result of an addition. The term is often used for any calculation in early mathematics, but its meaning is very specific at this level.

# TIP

Being able to communicate information effectively is a key 21st-century skill. As you work, think about what you are being asked to do in this task and how best to present your answers.

# 1.2 Multiples and factors

# Multiples

A multiple of a number is found when you multiply that number by a positive integer. You can think of the multiples of a number as the 'times table' for that number. For example, the multiples of 3 are  $3 \times 1 = 3, 3 \times 2 = 6, 3 \times 3 = 9$  and so on. The first multiple of any number is the number itself.

# WORKED EXAMPLE 1

a What are the first three multiples of 12?  
b Is 300 a multiple of 12?

# Answers

a 12,24,36

Multiply 12 by 1, 2 and then 3.

$$
\begin{array}{l} 1 2 \times 1 = 1 2 \\ 1 2 \times 2 = 2 4 \\ 1 2 \times 3 = 3 6 \\ \end{array}
$$

b Yes, 300 is a multiple of 12.

Divide 300 by 12. If it goes exactly, then 300 is a multiple of 12.

# TIP

Recognising the type of problem helps you to choose the correct mathematical techniques for solving it.

Word problems involving HCF usually involve splitting things into smaller pieces or arranging things in equal groups or rows.

# 1.3 Prime numbers

Prime numbers have exactly two different factors: one and the number itself.

Composite numbers have more than two factors.

The number 1 has only one factor so it is not prime and it is not composite.

# MATHEMATICAL CONNECTIONS

Later in this chapter you will learn how to write integers as products of prime factors. One of the reasons why it is important for 1 to NOT be defined is prime is to make sure that the prime factorisation of any number is unique.

# Finding prime numbers

Over 2000 years ago, a Greek mathematician called Eratosthenes made a simple tool for sorting out prime numbers. This tool is called the 'Sieve of Eratosthenes' and the diagram shows how it works for prime numbers up to 100.

<table><tr><td>1</td><td>2</td><td>3</td><td>4</td><td>5</td><td>6</td><td>7</td><td>8</td><td>9</td><td>10</td></tr><tr><td>⑪</td><td>12</td><td>⑬</td><td>14</td><td>15</td><td>16</td><td>17</td><td>18</td><td>19</td><td>20</td></tr><tr><td>21</td><td>22</td><td>⑲</td><td>24</td><td>25</td><td>26</td><td>27</td><td>28</td><td>29</td><td>30</td></tr><tr><td>⑲</td><td>32</td><td>33</td><td>34</td><td>35</td><td>36</td><td>37</td><td>38</td><td>39</td><td>40</td></tr><tr><td>④</td><td>42</td><td>⑲</td><td>44</td><td>45</td><td>46</td><td>47</td><td>48</td><td>49</td><td>50</td></tr><tr><td>51</td><td>52</td><td>⑳</td><td>54</td><td>55</td><td>56</td><td>57</td><td>58</td><td>59</td><td>60</td></tr><tr><td>⑥</td><td>62</td><td>63</td><td>64</td><td>65</td><td>66</td><td>67</td><td>68</td><td>69</td><td>70</td></tr><tr><td>⑦</td><td>72</td><td>⑳</td><td>74</td><td>75</td><td>76</td><td>77</td><td>78</td><td>79</td><td>80</td></tr><tr><td>81</td><td>82</td><td>⑧</td><td>84</td><td>85</td><td>86</td><td>87</td><td>88</td><td>89</td><td>90</td></tr><tr><td>91</td><td>92</td><td>93</td><td>94</td><td>95</td><td>96</td><td>97</td><td>98</td><td>99</td><td>100</td></tr></table>

Cross out 1, it is not prime.

Circle 2, then cross out other multiples of 2.

Circle 3, then cross out other multiples of 3.

Circle the next available number then cross out all its multiples.

Repeat until all the numbers in the table are either circled or crossed out.

The circled numbers are the primes.

Other mathematicians over the years have developed ways of finding larger and larger prime numbers. Until 1955, the largest known prime number had less than 1000 digits. Since the 1970s and the invention of more and more powerful computers, more and more prime numbers have been found. The graph below shows the number of digits in the largest known primes since 2000.

You should try to memorise the prime numbers between 1 and 100.

# INVESTIGATION

Why do mathematicians find prime numbers exciting?

One reason why prime numbers are interesting and intriguing is because there is a lot about them that we don't know and that mathematicians have not been able to prove.

1 Goldbach's conjecture (1742) is one of the oldest and best-known unsolved problems in number theory.

a What is Goldbach's strong conjecture?  
b A Peruvian mathematician, Harald Helfgott, has published a largely accepted proof of Goldbach's weak conjecture. Find out more about this.

# LINK

Today anyone can join the search for Mersenne prime numbers. This project links thousands of home computers to search continuously for larger and larger prime numbers while the computer processors have spare capacity.

# LINK

Prime numbers are used in codes and codebreaking. The larger the prime you use, the harder it is to break the code. This is why it is more and more important to find larger and larger primes.

# INVESTIGATION CONTINUED

2 The Mersenne prime number search relies on massive computing power to find large primes. There is no other way to work out where the nth prime number will be or what the distance between large primes will be. Riemann's hypothesis (1859) claims you can accurately pinpoint the distribution of prime numbers. An Indian mathematician, Dr Kumar Eswaran published a proof for this hypothesis in 2016, but it has received mixed responses and is not yet fully accepted.

a Riemann built his ideas on the prime number theorem. Find out what this is and express it in simple language.  
b Is there a proof for the existence of infinitely-many prime numbers?

3 And just for fun ... What is an emirp? Find some examples to show what these are.

3 a List the composite numbers greater than four, but less than 30.  
b Try to write each composite number on your list as the sum of two prime numbers. For example:  $6 = 3 + 3$  and  $8 = 3 + 5$ .  
4 Twin primes are pairs of prime numbers that differ by two. List the twin prime pairs up to 100.  
5 Is 149 a prime number? Explain how you decided.

# Prime factors

Prime factors are the factors of a number that are also prime numbers.

Every composite whole number can be broken down and written as the product of its prime factors. You can do this using tree diagrams or using division. Both methods are shown in Worked example 5.

# TIP

Remember, a product is the answer to a multiplication. So to write a number as the product of its prime factors you write it like this:

$$
1 2 = 2 \times 2 \times 3.
$$

Write the number as two factors.

If a factor is a prime number, circle it.

If a factor is a composite number, split it into two factors.

Keep splitting until you end up with two primes.

# TIP

Prime numbers only have two factors: 1 and the number itself. As 1 is not a prime number, do not include it when expressing a number as a product of prime factors.

Using division

# Using prime factors to find the HCF and LCM

When you are working with larger numbers you can determine the HCF or LCM by expressing each number as a product of its prime factors.

# WORKED EXAMPLE 6

$$

Underline the factors common to both numbers.

$$

Underline the largest set of multiples of each factor.

$$
2 \times 2 \times 2 \times 3 \times 3 \times 5 = 3 6 0

# 1.4 Working with directed numbers

When you use numbers to represent real-life situations like temperatures, altitude, depth below sea level, profit or loss and directions (on a grid), you sometimes need to use the negative sign to indicate the direction of the number. For example, you can show a temperature of three degrees below zero as  $-3^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ . Numbers like these, which have direction, are called directed numbers. So if a point  $25\mathrm{m}$  above sea level is at  $+25\mathrm{m}$ , then a point  $25\mathrm{m}$  below sea level is at  $-25\mathrm{m}$ .

# TIP

Once a direction is chosen to be positive, the opposite direction is taken to be negative. So:

if up is positive, down is negative  
if right is positive, left is negative.  
if north is positive, south is negative  
if above 0 is positive, below 0 is negative.

g a temperature of  $10^{\circ}C$  below zero

a fall of  $24\mathrm{m}$

i a debt of $2000

an increase of $250

k a time two hours behind local time

a height of  $400\mathrm{m}$

# Calculating with directed numbers

In mathematics, directed numbers are also known as integers. You can represent the set of integers on a number line like this:

![](images/23f3bdb00c039ffe0b6feaf9de3ed912d11cf87280b2a27307da6be6d930198f.jpg)

The further to the right a number is on the number line, the greater its value.

Directed numbers are important when describing temperatures. The Celsius (or centigrade) temperature scale places the temperature at which water freezes at zero. Positive temperatures indicate 'above freezing' and are warmer. Negative temperatures are below freezing' and are colder.

When you calculate with negative and positive integers, you need to pay attention to the signs and remember these rules:

- Adding a negative number is the same as subtracting the number.  $3 + -5 = -2$  
- Subtracting a negative number is the same as adding a positive number.  $3 - - 5 = 8$  
Multiplying or dividing the same signs gives a positive answer.  $-3 \times -5 = 15$  and  $-20 \div -4 = -5$  
- Multiplying or dividing different signs gives a negative answer.  $3 \times -5 = 15$  and  $15 \div -3 = -5$ .

# 1.5 Powers, roots and laws of indices

You know that  $2 \times 2 \times 2 \times 2 = 16$ .

You can write this in index notation as:

$$
2 ^ {4} = 1 6
$$

2 is the base

4 is the index

The index is also called a power or an exponent.

$$
\text {b a s e} \rightarrow 2 ^ {4} \text {— i n d e x}
$$

# Square numbers and square roots

A number is squared when it is multiplied by itself. For example, the square of 5 is  $5 \times 5 = 25$ . The symbol for squared is  $^2$ . So you can write  $5 \times 5$  as  $5^2$ .

The square root of a number is the number that was multiplied by itself to get the square number. The symbol for square root is  $\sqrt{}$ .

You know that  $25 = 5^2$ , so  $\sqrt{25} = 5$ .

# MATHEMATICAL CONNECTIONS

In Section 1.1 you learned that the product obtained when an integer is multiplied by itself is a square number.

You also know that  $-5 \times -5 = 25$ . However, the mathematical convention is that the square root sign only refers to the positive square root. This is why if you enter  $\sqrt{25}$  in your calculator you will always get the positive answer, 5.

If you want to indicate both the positive and negative square roots of 25 you need to write  $\pm, \overline{25}$ .

# Cube numbers and cube roots

A number is cubed when it is multiplied by itself and then multiplied by itself again. For example, the cube of 2 is  $2 \times 2 \times 2 = 8$ . The symbol for cubed is  $3$ . So  $2 \times 2 \times 2$  can also be written as  $2^3$ .

The cube root of a number is the number that was multiplied by itself to get the cube number. The symbol for cube root is  $\sqrt[3]{3}$ . You know that  $8 = 2^3$ , so  $\sqrt[3]{8} = 2$ .

# Finding powers and roots

You should know the squares of numbers from 1 to 15 (and their roots) and the cubes of numbers from 1 to 5 as well as they cube of 10. For other numbers, you can use your calculator to square or cube numbers quickly using the  $x^2$  and  $x^3$  keys or the  $x^2$  key. Use the  $\sqrt{}$  or  $\sqrt{}$  keys to find the roots.

# TIP

Not all calculators have exactly the same buttons.  $x^{\square}$ $x^{\prime}$  and  $\wedge$  all mean the same thing on different calculators. Make sure you know how to find powers and roots on your calculator.

If you don't have a calculator, you can use the product of prime factors method to find square and cube roots of numbers. This method is shown in Worked example 9.

# MATHEMATICAL CONNECTIONS

To solve equations like  $x^{2} = 25$  you need to find both the positive and negative square roots, so if  $x^{2} = 25$  then  $x = \pm \sqrt{25} = 5$  and  $-5$

# WORKED EXAMPLE 9

$$

$$
\sqrt {3 2 4} = 1 8

# REFLECTION

You have covered many of the concepts in this chapter earlier in your study of mathematics.

Which concepts did you remember really well?  
Why do you think you remembered these so well?  
- Did you find any new ways of doing things or better ways of explaining things as you worked through this chapter? Share your ideas with a partner.

# Other indices and roots

You have seen that square numbers are all raised to the power of two (5 squared  $= 5 \times 5 = 5^2$ ) and that cube numbers are all raised to the power of three (5 cubed  $= 5 \times 5 \times 5 = 5^3$ ). You can raise a number to any power. For example,  $5 \times 5 \times 5 \times 5 = 5^4$ . You read this as '5 to the power of 4'. The same principle applies to finding roots of numbers.

$$
\begin{array}{l} 5 ^ {2} = 2 5 \quad , \overline {{2 5}} = 5 \\ 5 ^ {3} = 1 2 5 \quad \overline {{1 2 5}} = 5 \\ 5 ^ {4} = 6 2 5 \quad 4 \overline {{6 2 5}} = 5 \\ \end{array}
$$

You can use your calculator to perform operations using any roots or squares.

The  $y^*$  key calculates any power.

So, to find  $75$ , you enter  $7\text{y}^{\prime}$  5 and get a result of 16 807.

The  $\sqrt[3]{\cdot}$  key calculates any root.

So, to find  $\sqrt[4]{81}$ , you enter 4  $\sqrt[4]{81}$  and get a result of 3.

Make sure that you know which key is used for each function on your calculator and that you know how to use it. On some calculators these keys might be second functions.

4 Write several square numbers as products of prime factors, using index notation. What can you say about the index needed for each prime?

# TIP

Remember that anything raised to the power of zero is equal to 1.

# The laws of indices

The laws of indices are a set of mathematical rules that allow you to multiply and divide numbers written in index notation without having to write them in expanded form.

Make sure that you remember these three important rules.

To multiply different powers of the same number, add the indices. For example,  $3^{2} \times 3^{5} = 3^{2 + 5} = 3^{7}$  and  $4^{-2} \times 4^{3} = 4^{-2 + 3} = 4$ .

To divide different powers of the same number, subtract the indices.

For example,  $3^{6} \div 3^{2} = 3^{6 - 2} = 3^{4}$  and  $\frac{4^{3}}{4^{7}} = 4^{3 - 7} = 4^{-4}$

To find the power of a power you multiply the indices. For example,  $(3^{1})^{2} = 3^{3 \times 2} = 3^{6}$  and  $(4^{2})^{-3} = 4^{2 \times -3} = 4^{-6}$

In general terms:

$$
\begin{array}{l} a ^ {m} \times a ^ {n} = a ^ {m + n} \\ a ^ {m} \div a ^ {n} = a ^ {m - n} \\ (a ^ {m}) ^ {n} = a ^ {n m} \\ \end{array}
$$

# Zero and negative indices

Do you remember how to work with zero and negative indices? Read through this information to refresh your memory.

In this table, each value is  $\frac{1}{5}$  of the one to its left. For example,  $5^4 \div 5 = 5^3$ .

<table><tr><td>Power of 5</td><td>54</td><td>53</td><td>52</td><td>51</td><td>50</td><td>5-1</td><td>5-2</td><td>5-3</td><td>5-4</td></tr><tr><td>Value</td><td>625</td><td>125</td><td>25</td><td>5</td><td>1</td><td>1/5</td><td>1/25</td><td>1/125</td><td>1/625</td></tr></table>

The pattern in the table shows that  $5^0 = 1$ . This is true for any number to the power of 0.

We can say  $a^0 = 1$  (where  $a \neq 0$ , because  $0^0$  is undefined.).

You can also see from the table that a number with a negative index is equal to its reciprocal with a positive index. For example:  $5^{-2} = \frac{1}{5^2}$ .

This is true for all negative indices.

We can say  $a^{-m} = \frac{1}{a^{m}}$  (where  $a \neq 0$ ).

# Fractional indices

Do you remember what a fractional index such as  $5^{\frac{1}{2}}$  means?

You can use the laws of indices to show the meaning of fractional indices.

$$
5 ^ {\frac {1}{2}} \times 5 ^ {\frac {1}{2}} = 5 ^ {(\frac {1}{2} + \frac {1}{2})} = 5 ^ {1} = 5
$$

ou also know that  $\sqrt{5}\times \sqrt{5} = 5$

$$
\mathrm {S o}, 5 ^ {\frac {1}{2}} = \sqrt {5}
$$

$$
5 ^ {1} \times 5 ^ {1} \times 5 ^ {1} = 5 ^ {1 + 1 + 1} = 5 ^ {1} = 5
$$

$$
\text {A n d} \sqrt [ 3 ]{5} \times \sqrt [ 3 ]{5} \times \sqrt [ 3 ]{5} = 5
$$

$$
\mathrm {S o}, 5 ^ {\frac {1}{2}} = \sqrt [ 3 ]{5}
$$

In general terms, for unit fractions:

$$
a ^ {\frac {1}{2}} = \sqrt {a} \quad a ^ {\frac {1}{2}} = \sqrt [ 3 ]{a} \quad a ^ {\frac {1}{2}} = \sqrt [ 3 ]{a}
$$

# LINK

Fractional indices and roots are used in many different financial calculations involving investments, insurance policies and economic decisions.

You can use the rule for finding the power of a power to show the meaning of fractional indices where the numerator is not 1 (non-unit fractions).

$$
(4 \frac {1}{2}) ^ {3} = 4 \frac {1}{4} \times \frac {1}{2}) = 4 \frac {1}{2}
$$

This shows that a number such as  $5^{\frac{1}{2}}$  can be written with a unit fraction index as  $(5^{\frac{1}{2}})^{2}$ .

You already know that you can write a unit fraction (such as  $\frac{1}{3}$ ) as a root.

$$
S _ {0} 5 ^ {\frac {1}{2}} = (5 ^ {\frac {1}{2}}) ^ {2} = (\sqrt [ 3 ]{5}) ^ {2}
$$

It is simpler to input the value in root form into your calculator than to enter  $5^{\ddagger}$ . In general terms, for non-unit fractions:

$$
a ^ {\frac {m}{2}} = \left(a ^ {\frac {1}{2}}\right) ^ {m} = \left(\sqrt [ n ]{a}\right) ^ {m} = \sqrt [ n ]{a ^ {m}}
$$

# TIP

Multiplication is

commutative, so

$(a^{\frac{1}{2}})^{m}$  is the same as

$$
(a ^ {m}) ^ {\frac {1}{n}} = \sqrt [ n ]{a ^ {m}}
$$

# APPLY YOUR SKILLS

4 The number of calories a mammal uses when they are at rest can be worked out using the formula  $C = 70 \times m^{\frac{1}{2}}$ , where  $m$  is the mass of the animal in kilograms.

a Express the formula using a root sign.  
b A cat has a mass of 5.5 kilograms. Work out how many calories it consumes while it is at rest.  
c How many calories would a  $5000\mathrm{kg}$  elephant consume at rest?

# 1.6 Order of operations

At this level of mathematics you are expected to carry out calculations involving more than one operation  $(+, -, \times$  and  $\div$ ). When you do this you have to follow a sequence of rules so that there is no confusion about what operations you should do first. The rules for the order of operations are:

complete operations in grouping symbols first  
- deal with powers and roots next  
do division and multiplication next, working from left to right.  
do addition and subtraction last, working from left to right.

Many people use the letters BODMAS to remember the order of operations.

The letters stand for:

Brackets

Orders

Divide Multiply

Add Subtract

BODMAS indicates that indices (powers of) are considered after brackets but before all other operations.

# Grouping symbols

The most common grouping symbols in mathematics are brackets. Here are some examples of the different kinds of brackets used in mathematics:

$$
\begin{array}{l} (4 + 9) \times (1 0 \div 2) \\ [ 2 (4 + 9) - 4 (3) - 1 2 ] \\ \{2 - [ 4 (2 - 7) - 4 (3 + 8) ] - 2 \times 8 \} \\ \end{array}
$$

# MATHEMATICAL CONNECTIONS

You will apply the order of operation rules to fractions, decimals and algebraic expressions as you progress through the course.

When you have more than one set of brackets in a calculation, you work out the innermost set first.

Other symbols used to group operations are:

- fraction bars, e.g.  $\frac{5 - 12}{3 - 8}$  
- root signs, such as square roots and cube roots, e.g.  $\sqrt{9 + 16}$

b 36÷4+100-36

Answers

a  $(4 + 28)\div (17 - 9)$

b 36÷4+100-36

$$
\begin{array}{l} = 3 2 \div 8 \\ = \sqrt {9} + \sqrt {6 4} \\ = 4 \\ = 3 + 8 \\ = 1 1 \\ \end{array}
$$

Now that you know what to do with grouping symbols, you can apply the rules for order of operations to perform calculations with numbers.

# Using your calculator

A calculator with algebraic logic will apply the rules for order of operations automatically. So, if you enter  $2 + 3 \times 4$ , your calculator will do the multiplication first and give you an answer of 14. (Check that your calculator does this!)

When the calculation contains brackets you must enter these to make sure your calculator does the grouped sections first.

# WORKED EXAMPLE 14

Use a calculator to find:

a  $3 + 2\times 9$

b (3 + 8) × 4

c  $(3\times 8 - 4) - (2\times 5 + 1)$

# Answers

a 21 Enter 3 + 2 9  
b 44 Enter 3 + 8 ） 4  
c 9 Enter 3 8 - 4 ） - 2 5 + 1 ）

Experiment with your calculator by carrying out several calculations, with and without brackets. For example:  $3 \times 2 + 6$  and  $3 \times (2 + 6)$ . Do you understand why these are different?

# TIP

Your calculator might only have one type of bracket (and If there are two different shaped brackets in the calculation, such as  $[4 \times (2 - 3)]$ , enter the calculator bracket symbol for each type.

# TIP

If you have forgotten how to round to significant figures, read through Worked example 16 in Section 1.7.

# MATHEMATICAL CONNECTIONS

When you work with indices and standard form in Chapter 5, you will need to apply these skills and use your calculator effectively to solve problems involving any powers or roots.

# 1.7 Rounding and estimating

In many calculations, particularly with decimals, you will not need to find an exact answer. Instead, you will be asked to give an answer to a stated level of accuracy. For example, you may be asked to give an answer correct to 2 decimal places, or to 3 significant figures.

# WORKED EXAMPLE 15

Round 64.839906 to:

a the nearest whole number  
b 1 decimal place  
c 3 decimal places.

# Answers

a 64.839906

4 is in the units place.

64.839906

The next digit is 8, so you will round up to get 5.

$= 65$  (to nearest whole number)

To the nearest whole number.

b 64.839906

8 is in the first decimal place.

64.839906

The next digit is 3, so the 8 will remain unchanged.

$= 64.8(1\mathrm{d.p.})$

Correct to 1 decimal place.

c 64.832906

9 is in the third decimal place.

64.839906

The next digit is 9, so you need to round up.

$= 64.840(3\mathrm{d}.p.)$

When you round 9 up, you get 10, so carry one to the previous digit and write 0 in the place of the 9.

Correct to 3 decimal places.

When a number has many digits or decimal places it is useful to round it to significant figures (s.f.). The first significant digit of a number is the first non-zero digit, when reading from left to right. The next digit is the second significant digit, the next the third significant and so on. All zeros after the first significant digit are considered significant.

If you are rounding to a whole number, write the appropriate number of zeros after the last significant digit as place holders to keep the number the same size.

# TIP

Rounding to 1 significant figure does not mean you will only have one digit. When 13432 is rounded to 1 significant figure it is 10000 and not 1.

# LINK

We use 'rounding' in all subjects where numerical data is collected. Masses in physics, temperatures in biology, prices in economics: these all need to be recorded sensibly and will be rounded to a degree of accuracy appropriate for the situation.

# WORKED EXAMPLE 16

# Round:

a 1.076 to 3 significant figures  
b 0.00736 to 1 significant figure  
c 23 512 435 to 2 significant figures

# Answers

a 1.0Z6

$$
= 1. 0 8 (3 \mathrm {s}. \mathrm {f}.)
$$

The third significant figure is the 7. The next digit is 6, so round 7 up to get 8.

Correct to 3 significant figures.

b 0.00Z36

$$
= 0. 0 0 7 (1 \mathrm {s}. \mathrm {f}.)
$$

The first significant figure is the 7. The next digit is 3, so 7 will not change.

Correct to 1 significant figure.

c 23512475

$$
= 2 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 (2 \mathrm {s}. \mathrm {f}.)
$$

The second significant figure is 3. The next digit is 5, so 3 will round up to 4.

Include the zeros and state the level of accuracy.

# Estimating to get an approximate answer

To estimate the answer to a calculation, you need to round the numbers before you do the calculation. Although you can use any accuracy, often the numbers in the calculation are rounded to 1 significant figure:

$$
3. 9 \times 2. 1 \text {i s a p p r o x i m a t e l y e q u a l t o} 4 \times 2 = 8
$$

Notice that  $3.9 \times 2.1 = 8.19$ , so the estimated value of 8 is not too far from the real value!

# WORKED EXAMPLE 17

Estimate the value of:

4.6+3.9 a 398

b 42.2-5.1

# Answers

4.6+3.9 is approximately equal to 5+4 398 400

$$
= \frac {9}{2 0} = \frac {4 . 5}{1 0} = 0. 4 5
$$

Check the estimate:

$$
\frac {4 . 6 + 3 . 9}{3 9 8} = 0. 4 2 6 (3 \mathrm {s . f .})
$$

Round the numbers to 1 significant figure.

If you use a calculator you will find the exact value and see that the estimate was good.

b  $\sqrt{42.2 - 5.1}$  is approximately equal to  $\sqrt{40 - 5}$

$$
= \sqrt {3 5}
$$

$$
i s \text {a p p r o x i m a t e l y e q u a l t o} \sqrt {3 6}
$$

$$
= 6
$$

Begin by rounding each value to 1 significant figure.

Notice that if you round 35 up to 36 you get a square number and you can easily take the square root.

A good starting point for the questions in the Exercise 1.19 is to round the numbers to 1 significant figure. Remember that you can sometimes make your calculation even simpler by modifying your numbers again.

# INVESTIGATION

# Making decisions about accuracy

There will be times when you have to decide how to round values to estimate. The place that you round to depends on the level of accuracy needed to solve each problem.

1 What would you round to in the following situations? Give reasons for your answers.

a A real-life problem involving whole numbers, for example bricks or numbers of people.  
b Problems involving money amounts.  
c Calculations using numbers in the millions.  
d Scientific calculations with original values to four places.  
e Problems involving irrational numbers (such as  $\pi$ ).

2 What have these students done to estimate?

[{7.6} \times  {0.518}]

Marwan  $\frac{{17} - {75} \times  {5.7}}{8.7}$  is approximately equal to  $\frac{2 \times  6}{1} = {12}$

a Why is each strategy useful?  
b Why do you use the  $=$  symbol in some parts of the estimation but state 'is approximately equal to' in others?

3 What situations can you think of where it is helpful to make sure your estimate is:

a an overestimate  
b an underestimate?

# TIP

When you are asked to estimate values, always show the rounded values that you use so anyone looking at your work knows what you have done.

You can think of algebra as the language of mathematics. When you learn a language, you have to learn its rules and structures. The language of algebra also has rules and structures. What are the students in the picture opposite trying to work out? What rules do you think these students are applying?

Algebra lets you describe and represent complex mathematical patterns in clear mathematical language. At school, and in the real world, you will use algebra in many ways. For example, you will use it to make sense of formulae and spreadsheets and you may use algebra to solve problems to do with money, building, science, agriculture, engineering, construction, economics, game design, animation and many other things.

# 2.1 Using letters to represent unknown values

In primary school you used empty shapes to represent unknown numbers. For example,  $2 + \square = 8$  and  $\square + \diamond = 10$ . If  $2 + \square = 8$ , the  $\square$  can only represent 6. But if  $\square + \diamond = 10$ , then the  $\square$  and the  $\diamond$  can represent many different values. In puzzles, shapes are often used to represent unknown numbers. Sometimes the shape can only represent one number, for example if  $2 + \square = 8$  then  $\square$  must represent 6. Other times, the shapes can represent many different numbers, for example if  $\square + \diamond = 10$ , then the  $\square$  and the  $\diamond$  can represent many different values. When letters can represent many different values they are called variables.

Algebra uses letters to represent unknown numbers. You could write the number sentences above as:  $2 + x = 8$  and  $a + b = 10$ . Number sentences like these are called equations. You can solve an equation by finding the values that make the equation true.

When you worked with area of rectangles and triangles in the past, you used algebra to make a general rule, or formula, for working out the area,  $A$ :

Area of a rectangle  $=$  length  $\times$  width, so  $A = h$

Area of a triangle  $= \frac{1}{2} \times$  base  $\times$  height, so  $A = \frac{1}{2} bh$  or  $A = \frac{bh}{2}$

When two letters are multiplied together, you write them next to each other, e.g. for  $l \times w$  you would write  $l \times w$ .

To use a formula you have to replace some or all of the letters with numbers. This is called substitution.

# Writing algebraic expressions

An algebraic expression is a group of letters and numbers linked by operation signs. Each part of the expression is called a term.

Suppose the average height (in centimetres) of students in your class is an unknown number,  $h$ . A student who is  $10\mathrm{cm}$  taller than the average will have a height of  $h + 10$ . A student who is  $3\mathrm{cm}$  shorter than the average will have a height of  $h - 3$ .

$h + 10$  and  $h - 3$  are algebraic expressions. Because the unknown value is represented by  $h$ , we say these are expressions in terms of  $h$ .

# LINK

Algebra is used across all science subjects. For example, in Biology algebra is used to model biochemical networks, and linear relationships such as heart rate (bpm) and cardiac output (how much blood your heart pumps) can be graphed and compared. In chemistry, equations are important for expressing relationships between quantities (for example, density, mass and volume). Many situations in physics require motion or other physical changes to be described as an algebraic formula, such as  $F = ma$ , which describes the connection between the force, mass and acceleration of an object.

# TIP

In an algebra problem, you must not change the 'case' of the letters being used. For example, 'n' and 'N' can represent different numbers in the same formula!

# WORKED EXAMPLE 1

Use algebra to write an expression in terms of  $h$  (which represents average height) for:

a a height 12 cm shorter than average  
b a height 2a taller than average  
a height twice the average height  
d a height half the average height.

# Answers

a  $h - 12$  Shorter than means less than, so you subtract.  
b  $h + 2a$  Taller than means more than, so you add. 2a is unknown, but it can still be used in the expression.  
$2\times h = 2h$  Twice means two times, so you multiply by two.  
d  $h\div 2 = \frac{h}{2}$  Half means divided by two.

# Applying the rules

You should write algebraic expressions in the shortest, simplest possible way:

$2\times h$  is written as  $2h$  and  $x\times y$  is written as  $xy$  
$h$  means  $1\times h$  , but you do not write the 1  
$h\div 2$  is written as  $\frac{h}{2}$  and  $x\div y$  is written as  $\frac{x}{y}$  
- when you have the product of a number and a variable, the number is written first, so  $2h$  and not  $h2$ . Also, variables are normally written in alphabetical order, so  $xy$  and  $2ab$  rather than  $yx$  and  $2ba$  
$h\times h$  is written as  $h^2$  (h squared) and  $h\times h\times h$  is written as  $h^3$  (h cubed). The  $\mathbf{2}$  and the  $\mathbf{3}$  are examples of a power or index  
the power only applies to the number or variable directly before it, so  $5a^2$  means  $5 \times a \times a$  
- when a power is outside a bracket, it applies to everything inside the bracket, so  $(xy)^3$  means  $xy \times xy \times xy$ .

# WORKED EXAMPLE 2

Write expressions in terms of  $x$  to represent:

a the number times four  
b the sum of the number and five  
c six times the number minus two  
d half the number.

# Answers

a x times four Let  $x$  represent 'the number'.

$$
= x \times 4 \quad \text {R e p l a c e ' t i m e s f o u r ' w i t h} \times 4.
$$

Leave out the  $\times$  sign, write the number before the variable.

# TIP

Mathematicians write the product of a number and a variable with the number first to avoid confusion with powers. For example, you would write  $x \times 5$  is as  $5x$  and not as  $x5$ , which is easy to confuse with  $x^5$ .

# WORKED EXAMPLE 2 CONTINUED

b Sum of x and five

$$

$$

Let  $x$  represent 'the number'.

Sum of means  $^+$  , replace five with 5.

Six times x minus two

$$

$$

Let  $x$  represent 'the number'.

Times means  $\times$  and minus means -, insert numerals.

$$

Leave out the  $\times$  sign.

d Half x

$$
= x \div 2
$$

Let  $x$  represent 'the number'.

$$

Many people use spreadsheets to store and process numerical information. You can use formulae in spreadsheets to work out the number of one 'cell' based on what is in other cells. These formulae follow the same rules of algebra that you used here.

# MATHEMATICAL CONNECTIONS

Algebra allows you to translate information given in words to a clear and short mathematical form. This is a useful strategy for starting to solve many types of problems. You will use these skills throughout the course, and you will apply them to specific problems in Chapter 22.

# 2.2 Substitution

Expressions have different values depending on what numbers you substitute for the variables. For example, imagine you are a waiter and you get paid $8 per hour. You can write an expression to represent your wages like this: 8h, where h is the number of hours worked. If you work 1 hour, then you get paid 8 × 1 = $8. So the expression 8h has a value of $8 in this case. If you work 6 hours, you get paid 8 × 6 = $48. The expression 8h has a value of $48 in this case.

# TIP

When you substitute values remember to write in the operation signs.  $8h$  means  $8 \times h$ , so if  $h = 1$ , or  $h = 6$ , you cannot write this in numbers as 81 or 86.

# WORKED EXAMPLE 3

$$

c  $2a^{3} = 2\times a^{3}$

$$
\begin{array}{l} = 2 \times 2 ^ {3} \\ = 2 \times 8 \\ = 1 6 \\ \end{array}

$$

d  $2a(a + b) = 2\times a\times (a + b)$  
Put back the multiplication signs.  
Substitute the values for  $a$  and  $b$ .  
In this case you can carry out two steps at the same time: multiplication outside the bracket, and the addition inside.

# DISCUSSION

What is the point of algebra?

Students sometimes ask why they have to learn algebra because they cannot see how it is useful.

Work with a partner to prepare a short presentation to convince the rest of your class that algebra is valuable and useful.

- Choose one of the topics in this chapter (or another algebra topic you like and know well).  
- Do research to find how this topic is useful in the real world.  
Prepare a slide show (or other presentation) to share what you find out. Include a description of the topic and how it is used. Provide at least three real-life examples.

# MATHEMATICAL CONNECTIONS

Think back to Chapter 1 and the different types of number that you have already studied.

# 2.3 Simplifying expressions

The parts of an algebraic expression are called terms. Terms are separated from each other by  $+$  or  $-$  signs. So  $a + b$  is an expression with two terms, but  $ab$  is an expression with only one term and  $2 + \frac{3a}{b} - \frac{ab}{c}$  is an expression with three terms.

The number in a term is called a coefficient. In the term  $2a$ , the coefficient is 2; in the term  $-3ab$ , the coefficient is  $-3$ . A term with only numbers is called a constant. So for example, in the expression  $2a + 4$ , the constant is 4.

# TIP

Remember, terms are not separated by  $\times$  or  $+$  signs. A fraction line means divide, so the parts of a fraction are all counted as one term, even if there is a  $+$  or  $-$  sign in the numerator or denominator. So,  $\frac{a + b}{c}$  is one term.

# Collecting like terms

Terms with exactly the same variables are called like terms.  $2a$  and  $4a$  are like terms;  $3xy^{2}$  and  $-xy^{2}$  are like terms.

The variables and any indices attached to them have to be identical for terms to be like terms, so  $2x^{2}y$  and  $-3x^{2}y$  are like terms but  $2x^{2}y$  and  $-3xy$  are not. Variables in a different order mean the same thing, so  $xy$  and  $yx$  are like terms  $(x \times y = y \times x)$ .

You can add and subtract like terms to simplify algebraic expressions. This is known as collecting like terms.

# WORKED EXAMPLE 6

Simplify.

a 4a+2a+3a

b 4a+6b+3a

c  $5x + 2y - 7x$

d  $2p + 5q + 3q - 7p$

e 2ab+3a2b-ab+3ab2

# Answers

a 4a+2a+3a

b 4a+6b+3a

$$
\begin{array}{l} = 9 a \\ = 7 a + 6 b \\ \end{array}
$$

Terms are all like.

Add the coefficients, write the term.

Identify the like terms (4a and 3a).

- Add the coefficients of like terms.

Write terms in alphabetical order.

c  $5x + 2y - 7x$

$$
= - 2 x + 2 y
$$

Identify the like terms (5x and  $-7x$

Subtract the coefficients, remember the rules.

Write the terms.

(You can also write this as  $2y - 2x$ .)

d  $2p + 5q + 3q - 7p$

$$
= - 5 p + 8 q
$$

Identify the like terms (2p and -7p; 5q and 3q).

Add and subtract the coefficients.

Write the terms.

$$
= a b + 3 a ^ {2} b + 3 a b ^ {2}
$$

e  $2ab + 3a^{2}b - ab + 3ab^{2}$  
Identify like terms; pay attention to terms that  
are squared because  $a$  and  $a^2$  are not like terms.  
Remember that ab means 1ab.

# TIP

You can rearrange the terms as long as you move the  $-$  and  $+$  signs with the terms to their right. For example:

$$
\begin{array}{l} 3 x - 2 y + 5 z \\ = 3 x + 5 z - 2 y \\ = 5 z + 3 x - 2 y \\ = - 2 y + 3 x + 5 z \\ \end{array}
$$

# TIP

Any  $^+$  or  $-$  that appears in an algebraic expression is attached to the term to its right. For example:  $3x - 4y$  contains two terms:  $3x$  and  $-4y$ . If a term has no symbol written before it, then you can assume that it is  $^+$

# Exercise 2.3

# 2.4 Working with brackets

When an expression has brackets, you normally have to remove the brackets before you can simplify the expression. Removing the brackets is called expanding the expression.

To remove brackets you multiply each term inside the bracket by the number (and/ or variables) outside the bracket. When you do this you need to pay attention to the positive and negative signs in front of the terms:

$$
x (y + z) = x y + x z
$$

$$
x (y - z) = x y - x z
$$

$$
- x (y + z) = - x y - x z
$$

$$
- x (y - z) = - x y + x z
$$

# TIP

Expanding brackets is really just multiplying, so the same rules you used for multiplication apply in these examples.

# WORKED EXAMPLE 9

a 2(2x+6)

Follow these steps when multiplying by a term outside a bracket:

- Multiply the term on the left-hand inside of the bracket first - shown by the red arrow labelled i.  
- Then multiply the term on the right-hand side - shown by the blue arrow labelled ii.  
Then add the answers together.

# Expanding brackets with negative coefficients

So far the numbers in front of the brackets you expanded were positive. You expand brackets in the same way when there is a negative number before the bracket, but you have to make sure you use the correct signs.

The key is to remember that a  $+^{\prime}$  or a  $-$  is attached to the number immediately following it and should be included when you multiply out brackets.

# WORKED EXAMPLE 11

$$

b  $4(y - 7) - 5(3y + 5) = 4y - 28 - 15y - 25$

Remember that the negative sign is attached to the 3.

Remember that both terms in the second bracket are multiplied by -5.

# 2.5 Indices

# Revisiting index notation

When you write a number using indices (powers) you have written it in index notation. Any number can be used as an index including 0, negative integers and fractions.

The index tells you how many times the base has been multiplied by itself. So:

<table><tr><td>\( 3 \times  3 \times  3 \times  3 = {3}^{4} \)</td><td>3 is the base, 4 is the index</td></tr><tr><td>\( a \times  a \times  a \times  a \times  a = {a}^{5} \)</td><td>\( a \) is the base, 5 is the index</td></tr></table>

# TIP

Try not to carry out too many steps at once. Show every term of your expansion and then simplify.

# WORKED EXAMPLE 12

Write each expression using index notation.

a xxxxx

b  $x\times x\times x\times y\times y\times y\times y$

# Answers

a XxXxXxX=x4

Count how many times  $x$  is multiplied by itself to give you the index.

b  $x\times x\times x\times y\times y\times y\times y = x^3 y^4$

Count how many times  $x$  is multiplied by itself to get the index of  $x$ ; then work out the index of  $y$  in the same way.

When you write a power out in full as a multiplication you are writing it in expanded form.

# The laws of indices in algebra

The laws of indices are very important in algebra because they give you quick ways of simplifying expressions. You will use these laws over and over again as you learn more and more algebra, so it is important that you understand them and that you can apply them in different situations.

# Multiplying the same base with different indices

Look at these two multiplications:

$$
3 ^ {2} \times 3 ^ {4} \quad x ^ {3} \times x ^ {4}
$$

In the first multiplication, 3 is the base and in the second,  $x$  is the base.

You already know you can simplify these by expanding them like this:

$$
3 \times 3 \times 3 \times 3 \times 3 \times 3 = 3 ^ {6} \quad x \times x \times x \times x \times x \times x \times x = x ^ {7}
$$

In other words:

$$
3 ^ {2} \times 3 ^ {4} = 3 ^ {2 + 4} \quad \text {a n d} \quad x ^ {3} \times x ^ {4} = x ^ {3 + 4}
$$

When you multiply index expressions with the same base you can add the indices:

$$
x ^ {m} \times x ^ {n} = x ^ {m + n}
$$

# WORKED EXAMPLE 13

Add the indices.

b  $2x^{2}y\times 3xy^{4} = 2\times 3\times x^{2 + 1}\times y^{1 + 4} = 6x^{3}y^{5}$

Multiply the numbers first, then add the indices of like variables.

# MATHEMATICAL CONNECTIONS

In finance, when you apply interest to savings, the value increases by the same percentage each day, month or other fixed period of time. This involves repeated multiplication by the same number. You will see this when you study compound interest in Chapter 17.

# TIP

Remember, every letter or number has a power of 1 (usually not written). So  $x$  means  $x^1$  and  $y$  means  $y^1$ .

# Dividing the same base number with different indices

Look at these two divisions:

$$
3 ^ {4} \div 3 ^ {2} \quad \text {a n d} \quad x ^ {6} \div x ^ {2}
$$

You already know you can simplify these by writing them in expanded form and cancelling like this:

$$
\begin{array}{l} \frac {3 \times 3 \times 3 \times 3}{3 \times 3} \quad \frac {x \times x \times x \times x \times x \times x}{x \times x} \\ = 3 \times 3 = x \times x \times x \times x \\ = 3 ^ {2} \quad = x ^ {4} \\ \end{array}
$$

In other words:

$$
3 ^ {4} \div 3 ^ {2} = 3 ^ {4 - 2} \quad \text {a n d} \quad x ^ {6} \div x ^ {2} = x ^ {6 - 2}
$$

When you divide index expressions with the same base you can subtract the indices:

$$
x ^ {m} \div x ^ {n} = x ^ {m - n}
$$

# MATHEMATICAL CONNECTIONS

You will use the multiplication and division rules more when you study standard form in Chapter 5.

# WORKED EXAMPLE 14

10x3y² 10x3x3x2 5xy

Divide the coefficients.

$$

$$

Subtract the indices.

$$
= 2 x ^ {2} y
$$

# The power 0

Any value divided by itself gives 1, so  $3 \div 3 = 1$  and  $x \div x = 1$  and  $\frac{x^4}{x^4} = 1$ .

If you use the law of indices for division you can see that  $\frac{x^4}{x^4} = x^{4 - 4} = x^0$

So, you can see that  $\frac{x^4}{x^4} = x^0 = 1$

Any value to the power 0 is equal to 1. So  $x^0 = 1$ .

# TIP

Remember: the coefficient is the number in the term.

# Raising a power

Look at these two examples:

$$
(x ^ {3}) ^ {2} = x ^ {3} \times x ^ {3} = x ^ {3 + 3} = x ^ {6} \quad (2 x ^ {3}) ^ {4} = 2 x ^ {3} \times 2 x ^ {3} \times 2 x ^ {3} \times 2 x ^ {3} = 2 ^ {4} \times x ^ {3 + 3 + 3 + 3} = 1 6 x ^ {1 2}
$$

By writing in expanded form like this you can see that  $(x^{3})^{2} = x^{6}$  and  $(2x^{3})^{4} = 16x^{12}$

When you have to raise a power to another power you multiply the indices:  $(x^{m})^{n} = x^{mn}$

# WORKED EXAMPLE 15

a  $(x^{3})^{6}$

b (3x4y3)2

$$

Multiply the indices.

c (p3)4÷(p6)2

$$
\begin{array}{l} = p ^ {3 \times 4} \div p ^ {6 \times 2} \\ = p ^ {1 2} \div p ^ {1 2} \\ = p ^ {1 2 - 1 2} \\ = p ^ {0} \\ = 1 \\ \end{array}
$$

Square each of the terms to remove the brackets and multiply the indices.

Expand the brackets first by multiplying the indices. Divide by subtracting the indices.

# TIP

When there is a mixture of numbers and letters, deal with the numbers first and then apply the laws of indices to the letters in alphabetical order.

# Negative indices

In Chapter 1 you learned how to use negative numbers as indices. You will now apply those rules to expressions containing letters.

Look at these two methods of working out.

Using expanded notation:

Using the law of indices for division:

$$
\begin{array}{l} x ^ {3} \div x ^ {5} = \frac {x \times x \times x}{x \times x \times x \times x \times x} \\ x ^ {3} \div x ^ {5} = x ^ {3 - 5} \\ = \frac {1}{x \times x} \\ = x ^ {- 2} \\ = \frac {1}{x ^ {2}} \\ \end{array}
$$

This shows that  $\frac{1}{x^2} = x^{-2}$

$$
\mathrm {S o}, x ^ {- m} = \frac {1}{x ^ {m}} (\mathrm {w h e n} x \neq 0)
$$

# TIP

In everyday language you can say that when a number is written with a negative power, it is equal to '1 over' the number to the same positive power. Another way of saying '1 over' is reciprocal, so  $a^{-2}$  can be written as the reciprocal of  $a^2$ , i.e.  $\frac{1}{a^2}$ .

When an expression contains negative indices, you apply the same laws as for other indices to simplify it.

# LINK

Negative indices are often used in units in physics. For example, you often write 'kilometres per hour' as 'kmh-1'.

# MATHEMATICAL CONNECTIONS

Both positive and negative indices are used in standard form. You will learn to use standard form to write very large or very small numbers in Chapter 5.

$$

The laws of indices can also help you find the value of an index in simple equations. For the same base, if  $a^x = a^n$ , then  $x = n$ .

For example,  $2^x = 8$ . You know that  $2^3 = 8$ , so  $2^x = 2^3$  and  $x = 3$ .

# WORKED EXAMPLE 17

When multiplying terms, add the indices.

$x^{m}\div x^{n} = x^{m - n}$

When dividing, subtract the indices.

$(x^{m})^{n} = x^{mn}$

When finding the power of a power, multiply the indices.

$x^0 = 1$

Any value to the power 0 is equal to 1.

x-m=1x

(when  $x\neq 0$

# Fractional indices

The laws of indices also apply when the index is a fraction. Look at these examples carefully to remind yourself what fractional indices mean in algebra:

$= x^{\frac{1}{2} +\frac{1}{2}}$  Use the law of indices and add the powers.

$$
\begin{array}{l} x ^ {\frac {1}{2}} \times x ^ {\frac {1}{2}} \\ = x ^ {1} \\ = x \\ \end{array}
$$

In order to understand what  $x^{\frac{1}{2}}$  means, ask yourself: what number multiplied by itself will give  $x$ ?

$= y^{\frac{1}{2} +\frac{1}{3} +\frac{1}{4}}$  Use the law of indices and add the powers.

$$
\begin{array}{l} \sqrt {x} \times \sqrt {x} = x \\ \mathrm {S o}, x ^ {\frac {1}{2}} = \sqrt {x} \\ y ^ {\frac {1}{2}} \times y ^ {\frac {1}{2}} \times y ^ {\frac {1}{2}} \\ = y ^ {1} \\ = y \\ \end{array}
$$

What number multiplied by itself and then by itself again will give  $y$ ?

$$
\sqrt [ 3 ]{y} \times \sqrt [ 3 ]{y} \times \sqrt [ 3 ]{y} = y
$$

$$
\mathrm {S o} y ^ {\frac {1}{4}} = \sqrt [ 3 ]{y}
$$

This shows that any root of a number can be written using rational indices.

$$
\mathrm {S o}, x ^ {\frac {1}{\mathrm {s}}} = \sqrt [ m ]{x}.
$$

# Dealing with non-unit fractions

Indices may contain non-unit fractions, for example  $x^{\frac{1}{3}}$  or  $y^{\frac{1}{3}}$ . To find the rule for working with these, you have to think back to the law of indices for raising a power to another power. Look at these examples carefully to see how this works:

$$
\begin{array}{l} x ^ {\frac {1}{3}} = \left(x ^ {\frac {1}{3}}\right) ^ {2} \quad \frac {1}{3} \times 2 = \frac {2}{3} \\ y ^ {\frac {1}{4}} = \left(y ^ {\frac {1}{4}}\right) ^ {3} \quad \frac {1}{4} \times 3 = \frac {3}{4} \\ \end{array}
$$

You already know that a unit fraction gives a root. So you can rewrite these expressions using root signs like this:

$$
\begin{array}{l} (x) ^ {2} = (\sqrt {x}) ^ {2} \text {a n d} (y) ^ {3} = (\sqrt {y}) ^ {3} \\ \mathbf {S o}, x ^ {1} = (\sqrt {x}) ^ {2} \text {a n d} y ^ {2} = (\sqrt {y}) ^ {2} \\ \end{array}
$$

# TIP

You can reverse the order of calculations here and the result will be the same.

In general terms:  $x^{*} = x^{m + 1} - (x^{1})^{m} = (\sqrt[m]{x})^{m}$

# TIP

$$
\begin{array}{l} = x ^ {\frac {1}{3} - \frac {1}{2}} \\ = x \frac {2}{1 0} - \frac {5}{1 0} \\ = x ^ {- \frac {1}{\mathrm {的}}} \\ = \frac {1}{x ^ {\frac {1}{3 0}}} \\ \end{array}

# SUMMARY

# Do you know ...?

Algebra has special conventions (rules) that allow you to write mathematical information in short ways.

Letters in algebra are called variables, the number before a letter is called a coefficient and numbers on their own are called constants.

A group of numbers and variables is called a term. Terms are separated by  $+$  and  $-$  signs, but not by  $\times$  or  $\div$  signs.

Like terms have exactly the same combination of variables and powers. You can add and subtract like terms. You can multiply and divide like and unlike terms.

The order of operations rules for numbers (BODMAS) apply in algebra as well.

Removing brackets (multiplying out) is called expanding the expression. Collecting like terms is called simplifying the expression.

Powers are also called indices. The index tells you how many times a number or variable is multiplied by itself. Indices only apply to the number or variable immediately before them.

The laws of indices are a set of rules for simplifying expressions with indices. These laws apply to positive, negative, zero and fractional indices.

# Chapter 3

# Lines, angles and shapes

# IN THIS CHAPTER YOU WILL:

- use the correct terms to talk about points, lines, angles and shapes.  
- classify, measure and construct angles  
calculate unknown angles using angle relationships  
- talk about the properties of triangles, quadrilaterals, circles and polygons  
- construct triangles using a ruler and a pair of compasses.

The photo on the previous page shows buildings and the harbour promenade in Hamburg, Germany. The architects have made good use of lines to draw in the eye and curves to add interest to the design. What mathematical challenges can you see in the design of this building?

Geometry is one of the oldest known areas of mathematics. Farmers in Ancient Egypt knew about lines and angles, and they used them to mark out fields after floods. Builders in Egypt and Mesopotamia used knowledge of angles and shapes to build huge temples and pyramids.

Today construction workers, surveyors and architects use geometry to plan and build roads, bridges, houses and office blocks. Lines and angles are also used when reading maps and in the software of GPS devices. Artists use lines and angles to get the correct perspective in drawings, opticians use them to make spectacle lenses and tennis and snooker players use them to work out how to hit the ball. Can you think of any other sports where lines and angles play an important role?

# GETTING STARTED

# 3.1 Lines and angles

Mathematicians use specific terms and definitions in geometry. You are expected to know what the terms mean and to use them correctly in your own work. Read through the table to remind yourself of the key terms and what they mean.

# Terms used to talk about lines

<table><tr><td>Term</td><td>What it means</td><td>Examples</td></tr><tr><td>Point</td><td>A point is shown on paper using a dot (·) or a cross (×). Most often you will use the word &#x27;point&#x27; to talk about where two lines meet. You will also talk about points on a grid (positions) and name these using ordered pairs of co-ordinates (x, y). Points are normally named using capital letters.</td><td>A·y
X B(2,3)
O
x</td></tr><tr><td>Line</td><td>A line is a straight (one-dimensional) figure that extends to infinity in both directions. Normally though, the word &#x27;line&#x27; is used to talk about the line segment that is the shortest distance between two points. Lines are named using starting point and end point letters.</td><td>A
B
line AB</td></tr><tr><td>Parallel</td><td>A pair of lines that are the same distance apart all along their length are parallel. The symbol || (or //) is used for parallel lines, e.g. AB || CD. Parallel lines are marked with arrows on diagrams.</td><td>A
B
C
D
AB || CD</td></tr><tr><td>Perpendicular</td><td>When two lines meet at right angles they are perpendicular to each other. The symbol ⊥ is used to show that lines are perpendicular, e.g. MN ⊥ PQ.</td><td>M
90° angle
P
N
MN ⊥ PQ</td></tr></table>

# TIP

The shortest distance between a point and a line is the perpendicular distance from the point to the line.

The photo shows the Harpa Concert Hall in Reykjavik, Iceland. The three-dimensional glass and steel bricks used to build the walls were inspired by the shape of basalt columns.

# INVESTIGATION

# Shapes and solids

1 Study the photograph of the Harpa Concert Hall. Try to find an example to illustrate each term in the table.  
2 How many types of polygon can you find in the design of the walls?  
3 Choose one of the 3D column-shaped bricks that you can see on the right-hand face of the building.

a What is the mathematical name for this type of shape?  
b Can you work out how many faces the shape has? How?

4 The Harpa building was designed using 3D digital modelling. The model was shared online as people in different countries worked on the design. Discuss these questions in groups.

a How can a 3D model help an architect design structures, lights, ventilation, electrical wiring and plumbing?  
b What advantages does 3D computer modelling have compared to plans drawn on paper?

# LINK

Builders, designers, architects, engineers, artists and jewellers use shape, space and measure as they work and many of these careers use computer packages to plan and design various items. Most design work starts in 2D on paper or on screen and moves to 3D for the final representation. You need a good understanding of lines, angles, shape and space to use computer-aided design (CAD) packages.

# Terms used to talk about angles

<table><tr><td>Term</td><td>What it means</td><td>Examples</td></tr><tr><td>Angle</td><td>When two lines meet at a point, they form an angle. The meeting point is called the vertex of the angle and the two lines are called the arms of the angle.Angles are named using three letters: the letter at the end of one arm, the letter at the vertex and the letter at the end of the other arm. The letter in the middle of an angle name always indicates the vertex.</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Acute angle</td><td>An acute angle is &gt;0° but &lt;90°.</td><td>ABC &lt; 90° DEF &lt; 90° MNP &lt; 90°</td></tr><tr><td>Right angle</td><td>A right angle is exactly 90°. A right angle is formed between perpendicular lines. A right angle is represented by a square in the corner.</td><td>XYZ = 90°; XY⊥ YZ</td></tr><tr><td>Obtuse angle</td><td>An obtuse angle is &gt;90° but &lt;180°.</td><td>A P Q
B C
ABC &gt; 90° PQR &gt; 90°</td></tr><tr><td>Straight angle</td><td>A straight angle is 180°. A line is considered to be a straight angle.</td><td>M

O
MO = straight line</td></tr><tr><td>Reflex angle</td><td>A reflex angle is &gt;180° but &lt;360°.</td><td>ABC &gt; 180°
DEF &gt; 180°</td></tr></table>

# TIP

Always take time to measure angles carefully. This is particularly important when you have to calculate using angles you've measured because a careless error can lead to several wrong answers.

<table><tr><td>Term</td><td>What it means</td><td>Examples</td></tr><tr><td>Revolution</td><td>A revolution is a complete turn: an angle of exactly 360°.</td><td>360°</td></tr></table>

# Measuring and drawing angles

The size of an angle is the amount of turn from one arm of the angle to the other. Angle sizes are measured in degrees  $(^{\circ})$  from 0 to 360 using a protractor.

![](images/726a4e5641c016ca015c2b2620b1fac2d4f15f2a81ebab13b18da068608325b7.jpg)

A  $180^{\circ}$  protractor has two scales. You need to choose the correct one when you measure an angle.

# LINK

Geographers and other geoscientists use a piece of equipment called a 'clinometer' to measure angles and calculate the heights of cliffs on the coastline. A clinometer looks and behaves quite like a protractor, but it usually also has an eyepiece, so that you can easily line up with the top of the cliff. Geologists, engineers and surveyors also use clinometers to work out heights, for example of microwave towers and satellite dishes.

![](images/b3ec97cdb0e66820954449bc319fb826f87e17392a733c1add67ca92d6f53176.jpg)

# MATHEMATICAL CONNECTIONS

You will use these skills when drawing pie charts in Chapter 4.

# TIP

If the arm of the angle does not extend up to the scale, extend the arm past the scale. The length of the arms of the angle does not affect the size of the angle.

# Measuring angles  $< {180}^{ \circ  }$

When an angle is smaller than  $180^{\circ}$  you can read the size from the scale onto the protractor.

# WORKED EXAMPLE 1

Measure angles ABC and PQR.

Answer

![](images/558d452badb9716eea3424a4b6554af380d46a3a3d57a78bbe6e72c42569d0c4.jpg)

Place the centre of the protractor at  $B$  and align the baseline so it sits on arm BC. Extend arm BA so that it reaches past the scale. Read the inner scale. Angle  $ABC = 50^{\circ}$

![](images/7a1baa8be10ec94069ccbde4b07504d4ff7ebbaf26202416a824f60b30c100c3.jpg)

Put the centre of the protractor at  $Q$  and the baseline along  $QP$ . Start at  $0^{\circ}$  and read the outer scale. Angle  $PQR = 105^{\circ}$

# Measuring angles  $>180^{\circ}$

Here are two different methods for measuring a reflex angle with a  $180^{\circ}$  protractor. Use the method that you find easier.

Suppose you had to measure the reflex angle  $ABC$ :

![](images/284a190081faaa58e417aeab358d5d4e1a133491df0e9cd101033fde509c90be.jpg)

Angle ABC is  $>180^{\circ}$

# TIP

If the word reflex is not included you can assume you are dealing with the angle between the two arms (acute, right or obtuse).

Method 1: Extend one arm of the angle to form a straight line (180° angle) and then measure the 'extra bit'. Add the 'extra bit' to 180° to get the total size.

![](images/08b1b166d694f1dd092982e518adacc6813c5315e72cd632f0a134f393029963.jpg)

Extend  $AB$  to point  $D$ . You know the angle of a straight line is  $180^{\circ}$ . So  $ABD = 180^{\circ}$ .

![](images/db4855b90942f30567ca2986195b4cab5966f39adbb22c60ff1d639548771f82.jpg)

Measure the other piece of the angle  $DBC$  (marked  $x$ ) and add this to  $180^\circ$  to find angle  $ABC$ .

$$
\begin{array}{l} 1 8 0 ^ {\circ} + 1 3 0 ^ {\circ} = 3 1 0 ^ {\circ} \\ \therefore A B C = 3 1 0 ^ {\circ} \\ \end{array}
$$

Method 2: Measure the inner (non-reflex) angle and subtract it from  $360^{\circ}$  to get the size of the reflex angle.

![](images/5b306145a7bff9274b47f5bfb11ed50f5eb3ed27885983e23f2fb8db3906168d.jpg)

You can see that the angle  $ABC$  is almost  $360^{\circ}$ .

![](images/124ce5789c4d5be85ad0a5110c4a6a85fcfb6b1bb2950734fc58a6cd8e7c66e7.jpg)

Measure the size of the angle that is  $< 180^{\circ}$  (non-reflex) and subtract from  $360^{\circ}$ .

$$
\begin{array}{l} 3 6 0 ^ {\circ} - 5 0 ^ {\circ} = 3 1 0 ^ {\circ} \\ \therefore A B C = 3 1 0 ^ {\circ} \\ \end{array}
$$

Place your protractor on the line with the centre at the vertex.

Measure the size of the angle you wish to draw and mark a small point.

For a reflex angle, draw a line as in (a) but mark one arm (X) as well as the vertex (Y). The arm should extend beyond the vertex to create a  $180^{\circ}$  angle.

Calculate the size of rest the angle:  $195^{\circ} - 180^{\circ} = 15^{\circ}$

Measure and mark the  $15^{\circ}$  angle (on either side of the  $180^{\circ}$  line).

Remove the protractor and use a ruler to draw a line from the vertex through the third point.

Label the angle correctly.

# TIP

To draw a reflex angle, you can also work out the size of the inner angle and simply draw that.

$360^{\circ} - 195^{\circ} = 165^{\circ}.$

If you do this,

remember to mark the reflex angle on your sketch and no the inner angle!

# Exercise 3.2

1 Use a ruler and a protractor to accurately draw the following angles:

a  ${ABC} = {80}^{ \circ  }$

b  $PQR = 30^{\circ}$

c  $XYZ = 135^{\circ}$

d  $EFG = 90^{\circ}$

e  ${KLM} = {210}^{ \circ  }$

f  $JKL = 355^{\circ}$

# PEER ASSESSMENT

Exchange the angles you drew in Exercise 3.2 with a partner.

1 Use your protractor to measure each angle and give them a rating from 1 to 4 for accuracy (1 is not very accurate and 4 is extremely accurate).  
2 What hints can you give people to help them draw angles as accurately as possible?

# Angle relationships

Make sure you know the following angle facts:

Complementary angles

Angles in a right angle add up to  $90^{\circ}$ .

When the sum of two angles is  $90^{\circ}$  those two angles are complementary angles.

![](images/ecc70d0c16d3b1512dd3ad98169e1ddb5805aa01b06ab3c6717cdf69a27caf28.jpg)  
$a + b = 90^{\circ}$

$x + y = 90^{\circ}$

# Supplementary angles

Angles on a straight line add up to  $180^{\circ}$ .

When the sum of two angles is  $180^{\circ}$  those two angles are supplementary angles.

$x + (180^{\circ} - x) = 180^{\circ}$

# Angles round a point

Angles at a point make a complete revolution.

The sum of the angles at a point is  $360^{\circ}$

$a + b + c + d + e = 360^{\circ}$

# Vertically opposite angles

When two lines intersect, two pairs of vertically opposite angles are formed.

Vertically opposite angles are equal in size.

![](images/65c9137920b9ff46a3c534e6477922a670717b5dee525204e66c08631ae9974f.jpg)

The angles marked  $x$  are equal to each other. The angles marked  $y$  are also equal to each other.

![](images/fd568a32da8c7e3a0081b0b14e959f5ec111e8cfd1e22945f669520fbf2154f3.jpg)  
$x + y = 180^{\circ}$

# TIP

In general terms:

For complementary angles, if one angle is  $x^{\circ}$ , the other must be  $90 - x^{\circ}$  and vice versa.

For supplementary angles, if one angle is  $x^{\circ}$ , the other must be  $180 - x^{\circ}$  and vice versa.

# TIP

The adjacent angle pairs in vertically opposite angles form pairs of supplementary angles because they are also angles on a straight line.

# Using angle relationships to find unknown angles

You can use the relationships between angles to work out the size of unknown angles.

To do this:

identify the relationship  
make an equation  
- give reasons for statements  
- solve the equation to find the unknown value.

# WORKED EXAMPLE 3

a  $72^{\circ} + x = 90^{\circ}$  angle ABC  $= 90^{\circ}$  comp angles)

$$
\begin{array}{l} x = 9 0 ^ {\circ} - 7 2 ^ {\circ} \\ x = 1 8 ^ {\circ} \\ \end{array}
$$

You are told that angle ABC is a right angle, so you know that  $72^{\circ}$  and  $x$  are complementary angles. This means that  $72^{\circ} + x = 90^{\circ}$ , so you can solve to find the value of  $x$ .

![](images/8021efb0fb66e606e53c25ab82c2a01ff911d174b1461b8a2a95b1a71db7e27f.jpg)

b  $48^{\circ} + 90^{\circ} + x = 180^{\circ}$  (angles on line)

$$
\begin{array}{l} x = 1 8 0 ^ {\circ} - 9 0 ^ {\circ} - 4 8 ^ {\circ} \\ x = 4 2 ^ {\circ} \\ \end{array}
$$

You can see that  $48^{\circ}$  the right angle and  $x$  are angles on a straight line. Angles on a straight line add up to  $180^{\circ}$ . So you can rearrange to make  $x$  the subject.

c  $x = 30^{\circ}$  (vertically opposite angles)

You know that when two lines intersect, the resulting vertically opposite angles are equal.  $x$  and  $30^{\circ}$  are vertically opposite, so  $x = 30^{\circ}$

# TIP

In geometry problems you need to present your reasoning in a logical and structured way.

You will usually be expected to give reasons when you are finding the size of an unknown angle. To do this, state the relationship that you used to find the unknown angle after your statements. You can use these abbreviations to give reasons:

comp angles

- supp angles

angles on line

angles round point

# Exercise 3.3

4 Two angles are supplementary. The first angle is twice the size of the second. What are their sizes?  
5 One of the angles formed when two lines intersect is  $127^{\circ}$ . What are the sizes of the other three angles?

# Angles and parallel lines

When two parallel lines are cut by a third line (the transversal) eight angles are formed. These angles form pairs which are related to each other in specific ways.

# Corresponding angles ( $F$ -shape)

When two parallel lines are cut by a transversal four pairs of corresponding angles are formed. Corresponding angles are equal to each other.

![](images/711d114740adf4f6be7de2c6d3225969f78b58468613156682b1d7d63ae6c4e0.jpg)

# Alternate angles (‘Z’-shape)

When two parallel lines are cut by a transversal two pairs of alternate angles are formed. Alternate angles are equal to each other.

# Co-interior angles ('C'-shape)

When two parallel lines are cut by a transversal two pairs of co-interior angles are formed. Co-interior angles are supplementary (together they add up to  $180^{\circ}$ ).

![](images/a1024e1357913e6f11e3fc15b7063ab1e9b4b6125ade30b061b0c7c01bf3b35d.jpg)

# TIP

Although  $F^{\prime},Z^{\prime}$  and  $C^\prime$  shapes help you to remember these properties, you must use the terms corresponding, 'alternate' and cointerior' to describe them when you answer a question.

# MATHEMATICAL CONNECTIONS

You will use the angle relationships in this section again when you deal with triangles, quadrilaterals, polygons and circles later in this chapter.

# TIP

'Co-means together. Co-interior angles are found together on the same side of the transversal.

Co-interior angles will only be equal if the transversal is perpendicular to the parallel lines (when they will both be  $90^{\circ}$ ).

The angle relationships around parallel lines and the other angle relationships from earlier in the chapter are very useful for solving unknown angles in geometry.

# WORKED EXAMPLE 4

Find the size of angles  $a, b$  and  $c$  in this figure.

# Answer

$a = 47^{\circ}$  (CAB alt SBA)

$c = 62^{\circ}$  (ACB alt CBT)

$a + b + c = 180^{\circ}$  (angles on line)

$\therefore b = 180^{\circ} - 47^{\circ} - 62^{\circ}$

$b = 71^{\circ}$

CAB and SBA are alternate angles and are equal. ACB and CBT are alternate angles and equal.

Angles on a straight line  $= 180^{\circ}$

You know the values of  $a$  and  $c$ , so can use these to find  $b$ .

Mathematical reasoning doesn't always involve numbers. You can use letters and algebra to get results that will be true for any numbers. Results like these are called generalisations or proofs.

1 Work in pairs. Use your reasoning skills to answer these general questions.

a If  $x + y = 180$  then  $180 - x = []?$  
b If  $x + y = 180$  then  $y = []$  
c If  $y = 180 - x$  and  $z = 180 - x$  what is  $y?$

# 3.2 Triangles

A triangle is a plane shape with three sides and three angles.

Triangles are classified according to the lengths of their sides and the sizes of their angles (or both).

# LINK

If you fix three straight sticks or rods together in a triangle it is not possible for the triangle to change its shape without breaking. This is why so many engineering structures use triangles for rigidity and strength.

![](images/3b9d9fc8435202bf85f44e73ec96a5fe5480010ec44d62848fa991d3eb4f2a84.jpg)

# TIP

Plane means flat. Plane shapes are flat or two-dimensional shapes.

# Scalene triangle

Scalene triangles have no sides of equal length and no angles that are of equal sizes.

# Isosceles triangle

Isosceles triangles have two sides of equal length. The angles at the base of the equal sides are equal in size.

# Equilateral triangle

Equilateral triangles have three equal sides and three equal angles (each is  $60^{\circ}$

# Other triangles

Acute-angled triangles have all angles  $<  90^{\circ}$

Right-angled triangles have one angle  $= 90^{\circ}$

Obtuse-angled triangles have one angle  $>90^{\circ}$

# Angle properties of triangles

The three angles inside a triangle are called interior angles.

If you extend a side of a triangle you make another angle outside the triangle. Angles outside the triangle are called exterior angles.

Look at the following diagram carefully to see two important angle properties of triangles.

The diagram shows two things:

the three interior angles of a triangle add up to  $180^{\circ}$  
- two interior angles of a triangle are equal to the opposite exterior angle.

If you try this yourself with any triangle you will get the same results. But why is this so? Mathematicians cannot just show things to be true, they have to prove them using mathematical principles. Read through the following two simple proofs that use the properties of angles you already know, to show that angles in a triangle will always add up to  $180^{\circ}$  and that the exterior angle will always equal the sum of the opposite interior angles.

Angles in a triangle add up to  $180^{\circ}$

To prove this you can draw a line parallel to one side of the triangle.

$$

but:

$$
b = x \text {a n d} c = y \text {(a l t e r n a t e a n g l e s a r e e q u a l)}
$$

$$
\text {s o} a + b + c = 1 8 0 ^ {\circ}

# 3.3 Quadrilaterals

Quadrilaterals are plane shapes with four sides and four interior angles.

Quadrilaterals are named and classified according to their properties.

# TIP

Some of these shapes are actually 'special cases' of others. For example, a square is also a rectangle because opposite sides are equal and parallel and all angles are  $90^{\circ}$ . Similarly, any rhombus is also a parallelogram. In both of these examples the converse is not true! A rectangle is not also a square. Which other special cases can you think of?

<table><tr><td>Type of quadrilateral</td><td>Examples</td><td>Summary of properties</td></tr><tr><td>Parallelogram</td><td>a = c b = d</td><td>Opposite sides parallel and equal. 
Opposite angles are equal. 
Diagonals bisect each other.</td></tr><tr><td>Rectangle</td><td></td><td>Opposite sides parallel and equal. 
All angles = 90°. 
Diagonals are equal.

One pair of opposite angles is equal.
Diagonals intersect at 90°.</td></tr></table>

# TIP

Each diagonal on a square or rhombus is the perpendicular bisector of the other because they intersect at  $90^{\circ}$  and divide each other into two equal lengths.

# The angle sum of a quadrilateral

All quadrilaterals can be divided into two triangles by drawing one diagonal. You already know that the angle sum of a triangle is  $180^{\circ}$ . Therefore, the angle sum of a quadrilateral is  $180^{\circ} + 180^{\circ} = 360^{\circ}$ .

This is an important property and you can use it together with the other properties of quadrilaterals to find the sizes of unknown angles.

# 3.4 Polygons

A polygon with all its sides and all its angles equal is called a regular polygon. If a polygon has any reflex angles, it is called a concave polygon. All other polygons are convex polygons.

# Angle sum of a polygon

By dividing polygons into triangles, you can work out the sum of their interior angles.

Can you see the pattern that is forming here?

The number of triangles you can divide the polygon into is always two less than the number of sides. If the number of sides is  $n$ , then the number of triangles in the polygon is  $(n - 2)$ .

The angle sum of the polygon is  $180^{\circ} \times$  the number of triangles. So for any polygon, the angle sum can be worked out using the formula:

sum of interior angles  $= (n - 2)\times 180^{\circ}$

# WORKED EXAMPLE 9

Find the angle sum of a decagon and state the size of each interior angle if the decagon is regular.

# Answers

sum of interior angles

$$
= (n - 2) \times 1 8 0 ^ {\circ}
$$

Sum of angles

$$
= (1 0 - 2) \times 1 8 0 ^ {\circ}
$$

A decagon has 10 sides, so  $n = 10$ .

$$
= 1 4 4 0 ^ {\circ}
$$

$$
= \frac {1 4 4 0}{1 0}
$$

$$
= 1 4 4 ^ {\circ}
$$

A regular decagon has 10 equal angles.

Size of one angle.

# WORKED EXAMPLE 10

A polygon has an angle sum of  $2340^{\circ}$ . How many sides does it have?

# Answers

$$
2 3 4 0 ^ {\circ} = (n - 2) \times 1 8 0 ^ {\circ}
$$

Put values into angle sum formula.

$$
\frac {2 3 4 0}{1 8 0} = n - 2
$$

$$
1 3 = n - 2
$$

$$
1 3 + 2 = n
$$

$$
\therefore 1 5 = n
$$

Rearrange the formula to get  $n$ .

So the polygon has 15 sides.

# The sum of exterior angles of a convex polygon

The sum of the exterior angles of a convex polygon is always  $360^{\circ}$ , no matter how many sides it has. Read carefully through the following information about a hexagon to understand why this is true for every polygon.

![](images/9b39a300dbc4f7bb4fae4aa714e8bfb5529cd21423499bd39fc846bc2fe24a6b.jpg)

A hexagon has six interior angles.

The angle sum of the interior angles  $= (n - 2) \times 180^{\circ}$

$$
\begin{array}{l} = 4 \times 1 8 0 ^ {\circ} \\ = 7 2 0 ^ {\circ} \\ \end{array}
$$

![](images/f2d33a5141ebb94d21c09f3767d29f85b6d85f6306cd0bf73a905262c792f7e2.jpg)

If you extend each side you make six exterior angles; one next to each interior angle.

Each pair of interior and exterior angles adds up to  $180^{\circ}$  (angles on line).

There are six vertices, so there are six pairs of interior and exterior angles that add up to  $180^{\circ}$ .

![](images/46b2d31ba3aa21d0f37e44a1af95d1eb1a240be3fdae75346ec5b242fda8211f.jpg)

$$
\therefore \text {s u m o f (i n t e r i o r + e x t e r i o r a n g l e s)} = 1 8 0 ^ {\circ} \times 6
$$

$$
= 1 0 8 0 ^ {\circ}
$$

But, sum of interior angles  $= 720^{\circ}$

$$
\begin{array}{l} \mathrm {S o}, 7 2 0 ^ {\circ} + \text {s u m o f e x t e r i o r a n g l e s} = 1 0 8 0 ^ {\circ} \\ \text {s u m o f e x t e r i o r a n g l e s} = 1 0 8 0 ^ {\circ} - 7 2 0 ^ {\circ} \\ \text {s u m o f e x t e r i o r a n g l e s} = 3 6 0 ^ {\circ} \\ \end{array}
$$

This can be expressed as a general rule like this:

If  $I =$  sum of the interior angles,  $E =$  sum of the exterior angles and  $n =$  number of sides of the polygon

$$
I + E = 1 8 0 n
$$

$$
E = 1 8 0 n - I
$$

$$
\text {b u t} I = (n - 2) \times 1 8 0
$$

$$
\begin{array}{l} \text {s o} E = 1 8 0 n - (n - 2) \times 1 8 0 \\ E = 1 8 0 n - 1 8 0 n + 3 6 0 \\ E = 3 6 0 ^ {\circ} \\ \end{array}
$$

# TIP

A regular polygon has all sides equal and all angles equal. An irregular polygon does not have all equal sides and angles.

# TIP

The rule for the sum of interior angles, and for the sum of exterior angles is true for both regular and irregular polygons. But with irregular polygons, you can't simply divide the sum of the interior angles by the number of sides to find the size of an interior angle: all interior angles may be different.

# 3.5 Circles

In mathematics, a circle is defined as a set of points which are all the same distance from a given fixed point. In other words, every point on the outside curved line around a circle is the same distance from the centre of the circle.

# LINK

The shortest route between any two points on the surface of the Earth is part of a circle which has a centre at the centre of the Earth. These circles are called 'great circles'. If you find a globe and look at the cities of Brasilia and Copenhagen, try to trace what you think will be the shortest route between the two. Can you image the circle you are tracing? Airliners often fly along great circles, to make the distance travelled as short as possible.

# TIP

A line outside the circle that touches the circumference at just one point is called a tangent.

# MATHEMATICAL CONNECTIONS

You will learn more about circles and the angle properties in circles when you deal with circle symmetry and circle theorems in Chapter 19.

# LINK

Look at the wheel of a bicycle as it travels along the road. You can see that the road forms a tangent to the circular wheel at all times.

# TIP

The plural of radius is radii.

# 3.6 Construction

In geometry, constructions are accurate geometrical drawings. You use mathematical instruments to construct geometrical drawings.

# Using a ruler and a pair of compasses

A ruler (sometimes called a straight edge) and a pair of compasses are the most useful construction tools. You use the ruler to draw straight lines and the pair of compasses to measure and mark lengths, draw circles and construct triangles.

![](images/1b7eaabe4703e638d3f6b4508387c7f32788afb3f2306b514f0389fc9be00ba5.jpg)

When you want to measure very accurately, you can use a pair of compasses to mark a given length. This method of drawing lines is useful in geometric construction. This example shows how to construct line  $AB$  that is  $4.5\mathrm{cm}$  long. (Because of printing, the following diagrams are NOT TO SCALE.)

Use a ruler and sharp pencil to draw a straight line longer than the length you need. Mark point  $A$  on the line with a short vertical dash (or a dot).

![](images/ca84938e21051602e7607d21000be33a8ba4b108e993f4329c72ffbc89ba0396.jpg)

- Open your pair of compasses to  $4.5\mathrm{cm}$  by measuring against a ruler.

![](images/4a2c435736b7affe9c38f053d88fdacb706f611e97e02b5ac93bece8b35476b8.jpg)

- Put the point of the pair of compasses on point  $A$ . Twist the pair of compasses lightly to draw a short arc on the line at  $4.5 \, \text{cm}$ . Mark this as point  $B$ . You have now drawn the line  $AB$  at  $4.5 \, \text{cm}$  long.

![](images/aed8666b868b2249939b4acc09d9a6fa5f8c61650d0945b9cade0b22044d5492.jpg)

# TIP

It is important that you use a sharp pencil and that your pair of compasses are tightened.

# TIP

Once you can use a ruler and pair of compasses to measure and draw lines, you can construct triangles and other geometric shapes.

# Constructing triangles

You can construct an accurate triangle if you know the length of three sides.

# WORKED EXAMPLE 11

Construct triangle ABC with  $AB = 5\mathrm{cm}$ $BC = 6\mathrm{cm}$  and  $CA = 4\mathrm{cm}$

Always start with a rough sketch.

Draw the longest side  $(BC = 6cm)$  and label it.

Set your pair of compasses at 5cm. Place the point on B and draw an arc.

Set your pair of compasses at 4cm. Place the point on C and draw an arc.

![](images/9ddebb2c7746cb187f98c5ae01b5b80a52a3d22242631940b7c46f55659bc2af.jpg)

![](images/118b0e2b8ae09affffb327bffb2b18e5831781596f2b394bc1c353514675ebc3.jpg)

The point where the arcs cross is A. Join BA and CA.

# TIP

It is a good idea to draw the line longer than you need it and then measure the correct length along it. When constructing a shape, it can help to mark points with a thin line to make it easier to place the point of the pair of compasses.

# TIP

Note that these diagrams are NOT TO SCALE but when you are asked to construct a triangle, you must use the accurate measurements!

Read this statement about learning:

'The best way to learn something is to do it.'

a Describe your experience of learning to construct accurate sketches.  
b What did you like best and what did you like least about the practical drawing work? Why?  
c Is the statement about learning true for you in the context of drawing accurate diagrams?

# SELF ASSESSMENT

What criteria could you use to assess how successful your learning was in this chapter?

Success criteria describe how you will know when you have learnt something. They help you decide whether you have achieved the learning intentions for this chapter or not.

1 Draw a table like this one:

<table><tr><td>Success criteria</td><td>Evidence of success</td><td>Improvements</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr></table>

2 Look back at the learning intentions at the start of this chapter. Use these to develop a list of criteria that you can use to decide whether you have met the learning intentions. For example:

I know all the key words and their meanings and I use them in my work.

3 Once you have your list, check your work against the success criteria.

- Place a tick (✓) in the second column if you can find evidence that you have met each one. (You are looking for how your work shows you have achieved the criteria.)  
If you cannot find evidence, write down what you can do to improve in that particular area.

4 Make any improvements that you need to over the next few days and then reassess your work using the same criteria.

# TIP

Success criteria are sometimes called 'what I'm looking for'.

# SUMMARY

# Do you know ...?

A point is position and a line is the shortest distance between two points.

Parallel lines are the same distance apart along their length.

Perpendicular lines meet at right angles.

Acute angles are  $< {90}^{ \circ  }$  ,right angles are exactly  ${90}^{ \circ  }$  ,obtuse angles are  $> {90}^{ \circ  }$  but  $< {180}^{ \circ  }$  . Straight angles are exactly  ${180}^{ \circ  }$  . Reflex angles are  $> {180}^{ \circ  }$  but  $< {360}^{ \circ  }$  . A complete revolution is  ${360}^{ \circ  }$  .

Scalene triangles have no equal sides, isosceles triangles have two equal sides and a pair of equal angles, and equilateral triangles have three equal sides and three equal angles.

Complementary angles have a sum of  $90^{\circ}$ . Supplementary angles have a sum of  $180^{\circ}$ .

Angles on a line have a sum of  $180^{\circ}$

Angles round a point have a sum of  $360^{\circ}$

Vertically opposite angles are formed when two lines intersect. Vertically opposite angles are equal.

# SUMMARY CONTINUED

# Do you know ...?

When a transversal cuts two parallel lines various angle pairs are formed. Corresponding angles are equal. Alternate angles are equal. Co-interior angles are supplementary.

The angle sum of a triangle is  $180^{\circ}$

The exterior angle of a triangle is equal to the sum of the two opposite interior angles.

Quadrilaterals can be classified as parallelograms, rectangles, squares, rhombuses, trapeziums or kites according to their properties.

The angle sum of a quadrilateral is  $360^{\circ}$ .

Polygons are many-sided plane shapes. Polygons are named according to the number of sides they have, e.g. pentagon (5), hexagon (6), octagon (8) and decagon (10).

Regular polygons have equal sides and equal angles.

Irregular polygons have unequal sides and unequal angles.

The angle sum of a polygon is  $(n - 2)\times 180^{\circ}$  , where  $n$  is the number of sides.

# Chapter 4

# Collecting,  
organising and  
displaying data

# IN THIS CHAPTER YOU WILL:

collect data and classify different types of data  
- organise data using tally tables, frequency tables, stem-and-leaf diagrams and two-way tables  
- draw pictograms, bar charts and pie charts to display data and answer questions about it.

People collect information for many different reasons. With the right information we can answer questions, make decisions, predict what will happen in the future, compare ourselves with others and understand how things affect our lives. A scientist might collect information from experiments or tests to find out how well a new vaccine is working. A business owner might collect data from surveys to find out how well the business is performing. A teacher might collect test scores to see how well the students perform in an examination and an individual might collect data from magazines or the internet to decide which brand of shoes, jeans, phone or car to buy. The branch of mathematics that deals with collecting data is called statistics. In this chapter, you will focus on asking questions and then collecting information and organising or displaying it so that you can answer questions.

# 4.1 Collecting and classifying data

Data is a set of facts, numbers or other information. Statistics involves a process of collecting data and using it to try and answer a question. The flow diagram shows the four main steps involved in this process of statistical investigation:

![](images/72b287863164cbdd9b7a5153088474ea9f31461def3571774bd16d299605c4aa.jpg)

# Different types of data

Answer these two questions:

Who is your favourite singer?  
How many people in your class wear glasses?

Your answer to the first question will be the name of a person. Your answer to the second question will be a number. Both the name and the number are types of data.

Categorical data is non-numerical data. It names or describes something without reference to number or size. Colours, names of people and places, yes and no answers, opinions and choices are all categorical. Categorical data is also called qualitative data.

Numerical data is data in number form. It can be an amount, a measurement, a time or a score. Numerical data is also called quantitative data (from the word quantity).

# TIP

Data is actually the plural of the Latin word datum, but in modern English the word data is accepted and used as a singular form, so you can talk about a set of data, this data, two items of data or a lot of data.

# TIP

The information that is stored on a computer hard-drive or your phone is also called data. In computer terms, data has nothing to do with statistics, it just means stored information.

# LINK

All of this work is very important in the fields of human and social sciences, where scientists need to present data to inform their conclusions.

Numerical data can be further divided into two groups:

- discrete data - this is data that can only take certain values, for example, the number of students in a class, goals scored in a match or red cars passing a point. When you count things, you are collecting discrete data.  
- continuous data - this is data that can take any value between two given values, for example, the height of a person who is between  $1.5\mathrm{m}$  and  $1.6\mathrm{m}$  tall could be  $1.5\mathrm{m}$ ,  $1.57\mathrm{m}$ ,  $1.5793\mathrm{m}$ ,  $1.5793421\mathrm{m}$  or any other value between  $1.5\mathrm{m}$  and  $1.6\mathrm{m}$  depending on the degree of accuracy used. Heights, masses, distances and temperatures are all examples of continuous data. You normally collect continuous data by measuring.

# TIP

One way to decide if data is continuous is to ask whether it is possible for the values to be fractions or decimals. If the answer is yes, the data is usually continuous. But be careful:

- age may seem to be discrete, because it is often given in full years, but it is actually continuous because we are getting older all the time  
- shoe sizes are discrete, even though you can get shoes in half sizes, because you don't get shoes in size  $7\frac{1}{4}$  or  $7\frac{3}{4}$  or  $7\frac{8}{9}$ .

# MATHEMATICAL CONNECTIONS

You will need to fully understand continuous data when you study histograms in Chapter 20.

# Methods of collecting data

Data can be collected from primary sources by doing surveys or interviews, by asking people to complete questionnaires, by doing experiments or by counting and measuring. Data from primary sources is known as primary data.

Data can also be collected from secondary sources. This involves using existing data to find the information you need. For example, if you use data from an internet site or even from the pages of this book to help answer a question, to you this is a secondary source. Data from secondary sources is known as secondary data.

# Exercise 4.1

1 Draw a table like this one.

<table><tr><td>Categorical data</td><td>Numerical data</td></tr><tr><td>Hair colour</td><td>Number of people in household</td></tr></table>

a Add five examples of categorical data and five examples of numerical data that could be collected about each student in your class.  
b Look at the numerical examples in your table. Circle any that will give discrete data.

# LINK

Geographers and biologists use both discrete and continuous data. For example, they measure temperature or rainfall using continuous scales, but counting discrete numbers of people or animals in a particular place at a particular time.

2 State whether the following data is discrete or continuous.

Mass of each animal in a herd.  
b Number of animals per household.  
c Time taken to travel to school.  
d Volume of water evaporating from a dam.  
e Number of correct answers in a spelling test.  
f Distance people travel to work.  
g Foot length of each student in a class.  
h Shoe size of each student in a class.  
i Head circumference of new-born babies.  
Number of children per family.  
k Number of TV programmes watched in the last month.  
Number of cars crossing a bridge per hour.

In 2021, a leading college foundation in the United States identified 'data scientist' as an important job with good prospects – the projected growth rate of jobs in this field is  $16\%$  (more than triple the  $5\%$  national growth rate for jobs in other fields). The use of computers in data collection and processing means that data collection, display and analysis have become more and more important to business and other organisations.

Stanford University is working with schools and education authorities to build data science into the maths curriculum at all levels. Their point of view is that this is much more important maths than many of the other traditional things taught in schools.

3 For each of the following questions state:

i one method you could use to collect the data  
ii whether the source of the data is primary or secondary  
iii whether the data is categorical or numerical  
iv for the numerical data, whether it is discrete or continuous.  
a How many times will you get heads if you toss a coin 100 times?  
b Which is the most popular TV show among your classmates?  
c What are the lengths of the ten longest rivers in the world?  
What is the favourite sport of students in your school?  
e How many books are taken out per week from the school library?  
f Is it more expensive to drive to work than to use public transport?  
g Is there a connection between shoe size and height?  
What is the most popular colour of car?  
What is the batting average of the national cricket team this season?  
j How many pieces of fruit do you eat in a week?

# 4.2 Organising data

When you collect a large amount of data you need to organise it so that it is easy to read and use. Tables (tally tables, frequency tables and two-way tables) are the most commonly used methods of organising data.

# Tally tables

A tally table is used to keep a record when you count things.

# TIP

Remember each tally (I) shows one item. Tallies are grouped in fives (JH) to make it easier to get a total when you need one.

# MATHEMATICAL CONNECTIONS

You will use and extend these methods of organising data in later chapters. Make sure that you understand them now.

# WORKED EXAMPLE 1

Aisha wanted to find out what people thought about pop-up adverts on their social media feeds. She did a survey of 100 people. Each person chose an answer A, B, C or D.

What do you think about this statement? Please choose one response.

Advertising should be strictly controlled on social media. Pop-up adverts should be banned from all social media feeds.

A I strongly agree

<table><tr><td>Response</td><td>Tally</td></tr><tr><td>A</td><td>HHHHHHIII</td></tr><tr><td>B</td><td>HHHHHHIII</td></tr><tr><td>C</td><td>HHHHHHHHHHII</td></tr><tr><td>D</td><td>HHHHHH</td></tr></table>

Count each letter. Make a tally each time you count one.

It may help to cross the letters off the list as you count them.

Check that your tallies add up to 100 to make sure you have included all the scores. (It is more efficient to work across the rows or down the columns, putting a tally into the correct row in your table, rather than counting one letter at a time.)

b The results suggest that people generally don't think advertising should be banned on social media. 57 people disagreed or strongly disagreed. Only 24 of the 100 people strongly agreed with Aisha's statement.

By giving people a very definite statement and asking them to respond to it, Aisha has shown her own bias and that could affect the results of her survey. It is quite possible that people think some control is necessary, but not that adverts should be banned completely. However, they don't have that as an option when they answer. The people in the sample could also affect the responses, so Aisha will have to carefully consider any conclusions from this survey.

# Exercise 4.2

1 Balsem recorded how many students left the classroom during a lesson for 50 lessons. Draw a tally table to organise this data.

2 Do a quick survey among your class to find out how many hours each person usually spends doing their homework each day. Draw your own tally table to record and organise your data.  
3 Faizel threw two dice together 250 times and recorded the score he got using a tally table.

<table><tr><td>Score</td><td>Tally</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>HH II</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>HH HN HN</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>HH HN HN HN III</td></tr><tr><td>5</td><td>HH HN HN HN HN III</td></tr><tr><td>6</td><td>HH HN HN HN HN III</td></tr><tr><td>7</td><td>HH HN HN HN HN HN I</td></tr><tr><td>8</td><td>HH HN HN HN HN HN</td></tr><tr><td>9</td><td>HH HN HN HN HN III</td></tr><tr><td>10</td><td>HH HN HN HN I</td></tr><tr><td>11</td><td>HH HN II .</td></tr><tr><td>12</td><td>HH I</td></tr></table>

a Which score occurred most often?  
b Which two scores occurred least often?  
c Why do you think Faizel left out the score of one?  
Why do you think he scored six, seven and eight so many times?

# Frequency tables

A frequency table shows the totals of the tally marks. Some frequency tables include the tallies.

This frequency table shows the number of cars there were of each colour in a car park. It has a column for tallies and another column for the totals (frequencies) of the tallies.

<table><tr><td>Colour</td><td>Number of cars</td><td>Frequency</td></tr><tr><td>White</td><td>HHHHIII</td><td>13</td></tr><tr><td>Red</td><td>HHHHHH</td><td>21</td></tr><tr><td>Black</td><td>HHHHHHHHHHHH</td><td>37</td></tr><tr><td>Blue</td><td>HHHHHHHHHH</td><td>27</td></tr><tr><td>Silver</td><td>HHHHHHHHHHHHHH</td><td>43</td></tr><tr><td>Green</td><td>HHHHHH</td><td>16</td></tr><tr><td colspan="2"></td><td>Total 157</td></tr></table>

# TIP

The frequency column tells you how often (how frequently) each result appears in the data.

The frequency table has space to write a total at the bottom of the frequency column. This helps you to know how many pieces of data were collected. In this example the student recorded the colours of 157 cars.

Most frequency tables will not include tally marks. Here is a frequency table without tallies. It was created by the staff at a clinic to record how many people were treated for different diseases in one week.

<table><tr><td>Illness</td><td>Frequency</td></tr><tr><td>Diabetes</td><td>30</td></tr><tr><td>HIV/AIDS</td><td>40</td></tr><tr><td>Tuberculosis (TB)</td><td>60</td></tr><tr><td>Other</td><td>50</td></tr><tr><td>Total</td><td>180</td></tr></table>

# Grouping data in class intervals

Numerical data can be recorded in different groups. For example, if you collected test results for 40 students you might find that students scored between 40 and 84 (out of 100). If you recorded each individual score (and they could all be different) you would get a very large frequency table that is difficult to manage. To simplify things, you can arrange the collected data in groups called class intervals. A frequency table with results arranged in class intervals is called a grouped frequency table. Look at this example:

<table><tr><td>Points scored</td><td>Frequency</td></tr><tr><td>40–44</td><td>7</td></tr><tr><td>45–49</td><td>3</td></tr><tr><td>50–54</td><td>3</td></tr><tr><td>55–59</td><td>3</td></tr><tr><td>60–64</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>65–69</td><td>5</td></tr><tr><td>70–74</td><td>3</td></tr><tr><td>75–90</td><td>7</td></tr><tr><td>80–84</td><td>9</td></tr><tr><td>Total</td><td>40</td></tr></table>

The range of scores (40-84) has been divided into class intervals. Notice that the class intervals do not overlap so it is clear which data goes in what class.

# TIP

This data suggests that TB is the most common illness at this clinic. However, this does not mean that TB is the most common illness in the community. This data could have been collected during a week where there was a special TB clinic or when patients collected their medication. You need to think carefully about data and what you can or cannot conclude from it.

# MATHEMATICAL CONNECTIONS

You will use tables like these to construct bar charts and histograms. These diagrams give a clear, visual impression of the data.

# Exercise 4.3

1 Sheldon did a survey to find out how many coins the students in a class had in their pockets or purses. These are the results:

<table><tr><td>0</td><td>2</td><td>3</td><td>1</td><td>4</td><td>6</td><td>3</td><td>6</td><td>7</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>2</td><td>4</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>6</td><td>5</td><td>4</td><td>8</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td>6</td><td>3</td><td>2</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>2</td><td>4</td><td>3</td><td>5</td></tr></table>

a Copy this frequency table and use it to organise Sheldon's data.

Use a grouped frequency table to organise the data.

# TIP

Note that currency (money) is discrete data because when you are paying for an item in dollars you cannot use a coin smaller than one cent.

# Stem-and-leaf diagrams

A stem-and-leaf diagram allows you to organise and display grouped data using the actual data values. When you use a frequency table to organise grouped data you cannot see the actual data values, just the number of data items in each group. Stem-and-leaf diagrams are useful because when you keep the actual values, you can calculate the range and averages for the data.

# LINK

Sociologists and geographers sometimes draw population pyramids. These are sideways bar charts that show the numbers of people in various age categories. These charts look similar to stem-and-leaf diagrams.

In a stem-and-leaf diagram each data item is broken into two parts: a stem and a leaf. The final digit of each value is the leaf and the previous digits are the stem. The stems are written to the left of a vertical line and the leaves are written to the right of the vertical line. For example, a score of 13 is shown as:

<table><tr><td>Stem</td><td>Leaf</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>3</td></tr></table>

In this case, the tens digit is the stem and the units digit is the leaf.

A larger data value such as 259 is shown as:

<table><tr><td>Stem</td><td>Leaf</td></tr><tr><td>25</td><td>9</td></tr></table>

In this case, the stem represents both the tens and the hundreds digits while the units digit is the leaf.

To be useful, a stem-and-leaf diagram should have at least five stems. If the number of stems is less than that, you can split the leaves into two (or sometimes even five) classes. If you do this, each stem is listed twice and the leaves are grouped into a lower and higher class. For example, if the stem is tens and the leaves are units, you can make two classes like this:

<table><tr><td>Stem</td><td>Leaf</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>0 3 4 2 1</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>5 9 8 7 5 6</td></tr></table>

Values from 10 to 14 (leaves 0 to 4) are included in the first class, values from 15 to 19 (leaves 5 to 9) are included in the second class.

Stem-and-leaf diagrams are easier to work with if the leaves are ordered from smallest to greatest.

# MATHEMATICAL CONNECTIONS

You will work with stem-and-leaf diagrams again when you calculate averages and measures of spread in Chapter 12.

# WORKED EXAMPLE 2

This data set shows the ages of customers in a café one lunchtime.

<table><tr><td>34</td><td>23</td><td>40</td><td>35</td><td>25</td><td>28</td><td>18</td><td>32</td></tr><tr><td>37</td><td>29</td><td>19</td><td>17</td><td>32</td><td>55</td><td>36</td><td>42</td></tr><tr><td>33</td><td>20</td><td>25</td><td>34</td><td>48</td><td>39</td><td>36</td><td>30</td></tr></table>

Draw a stem-and-leaf diagram to display this data.

Answers  

<table><tr><td>Stem</td><td>Leaf</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>8 9 7</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>3 5 8 9 0 5</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>4 5 2 7 6 6 3 4 2 9 0</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>0 2 8</td></tr><tr><td>5</td><td>5</td></tr></table>

<table><tr><td>Stem</td><td>Leaf</td><td>Key</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>7 8 9</td><td rowspan="5">1 | 7 represents 17</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>0 3 5 5 8 9</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>0 2 2 3 4 4 5 6 6 7 9</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>0 2 8</td></tr><tr><td>5</td><td>5</td></tr></table>

Group the ages in intervals of ten, 10-19; 20-29 and so on.

These are two-digit numbers, so the tens digit is the stem.

List the stems in ascending order down the left of the diagram.

Work through the data in the order it is given, writing the units digits (the leaves) in a row next to the appropriate stem. Space the leaves to make them easier to read.

If you need to work with the data, you can redraw the diagram, putting the leaves in ascending order.

From this reorganised stem-and-leaf diagram you can quickly see that:

the youngest person using the internet cafe was 17 years old (the first data item)  
the oldest person was 55 (the last data item)  
- most users were in the age group 30-39 (the group with the largest number of leaves).

If you want to show two sets of data, you can use a back-to-back stem-and-leaf diagram. The second set of data is plotted against the same stem, but the leaves are written to the left.

<table><tr><td>Brand X
Leaf</td><td>Stem</td><td>Brand Y
Leaf</td></tr><tr><td>9 4 8 7 2</td><td>0</td><td>5 8</td></tr><tr><td>7 8 7 2 3</td><td>1</td><td>4 7 8 2</td></tr><tr><td>8 4 6 2 7 9 8</td><td>2</td><td>8 9 7 1 5</td></tr><tr><td>7 2</td><td>3</td><td>7 2 1 0</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>4</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>5</td><td>1</td></tr></table>

<table><tr><td>Key</td></tr><tr><td>Brand X 8 | 2 represents 28 hours
Brand Y 4 | 2 represents 42 hours</td></tr></table>

This stem-and-leaf diagram compares the battery life (between charges) of two different brands of mobile phone. You read the data for Brand X from right to left. The stem is still the tens digit.

# Two-way tables

A two-way table shows the frequency of certain results for two or more sets of data. Here is a two-way table showing how many people in cars were wearing their seat belts when they passed a check point.

<table><tr><td></td><td>Wearing a seat belt</td><td>Not wearing a seat belt</td></tr><tr><td>Drivers</td><td>10</td><td>4</td></tr><tr><td>Passengers</td><td>6</td><td>3</td></tr></table>

The headings at the top of the table give you information about wearing seat belts. The headings down the side of the table give you information about drivers and passengers.

You can use the table to find out:

how many drivers were wearing seat belts  
how many passengers were wearing seat belts  
how many drivers were not wearing seat belts  
how many passengers were not wearing seat belts.

You can also add the totals across and down to work out:

how many drivers were surveyed  
how many passengers were surveyed  
- how many people (drivers and passengers) were wearing seat belts or not wearing seat belts.

Here are two more examples of two-way tables:

# 4.3 Using charts to display data

Charts are useful for displaying data because you can see patterns and trends easily and quickly. You can also compare different sets of data easily. In this section you are going to revise what you already know about how to draw and make sense of pictograms, bar charts and pie charts.

# Pictograms

Pictograms are fairly simple charts. Small symbols (pictures) are used to represent quantities. The meaning of the symbol and the amount it represents (a 'key') must be provided for the graph to make sense.

# WORKED EXAMPLE 4

This pictogram shows the amount of time that five friends spent talking on their phones during one week.

Tourist numbers dropped dramatically in 2020 and 2021 as travel was severely restricted due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Data scientists predict that it may take years for the numbers to return to these 2019 levels.

# TIP

The number of arrivals represented by the key should be an integer that is easily divided into the data; you may also need to round the data to a suitable degree of accuracy.

# Bar charts

Bar charts are normally used to display discrete data. The chart shows information as a series of bars plotted against a scale on the axis. The bars can be horizontal or vertical.

![](images/8972cad4ccd0a9e8f4835653555b8635e7c3c925b4e07620281eb78c72a6a310.jpg)

There are different methods of drawing bar charts, but all bar charts should have:

a title that tells you what data is being displayed  
- a number scale or axis (so you can work out how many are in each class) and a label on the scale that tells you what the numbers stand for  
a scale or axis that lists the categories displayed  
- bars that are equally wide and equally spaced  
- bars that do not touch for qualitative of discrete data.

# WORKED EXAMPLE 5

This frequency table shows the number of people who were treated for road accident injuries in the casualty department of a large hospital in the first six months of a year. Draw a bar chart to represent the data. Note that bar chart's frequency axis should start from zero.

# MATHEMATICAL CONNECTIONS

A bar chart is not the same as a histogram. A histogram is often used for continuous data. You will learn more about histograms in Chapter 20.

# Dual bar charts

A dual bar chart displays two or more sets of data side-by-side on the same set of axes to make it easy to compare the data. This chart compares the percentage of Fortune 500 companies using different social media platforms in 2019 and 2020.

Data source: Center for Marketing Research, University of Massachusetts, Dartmouth

# TIP

Fortune 500 is a yearly list of the 500 biggest companies (by revenue) in the USA. Many of the companies are multinationals that operate globally.

The graph shows that LinkedIn is the most popular platform, used by  $99\%$  of companies. Use of mainstream social media decreased slightly between 2019 and 2020, but public facing blog usage increased dramatically as companies needed to communicate with the public online during the COVID-19 pandemic. A few companies started to use TikTok in 2020 and analysts predict this will increase as companies target customers in the age groups that prefer this platform.

# Composite bar charts

A composite (stacked) bar chart breaks the whole set of data shown on each bar into groups.

This composite bar graph shows the percentage of the total time that different athletes spend on three events in a triathlon. The bars are the same length because they all represent  $100\%$  of the time taken.

![](images/a0ea85a74352d1d6d0c6465e37519ae1fc9e2160bcba0796500fa2b0cd3287e2.jpg)

The graph shows that Zawadi spent most of the time cycling (about  $80\%$ ). By comparison, Kofi only spent about  $10\%$  of the time cycling.

This composite bar graph shows the number of students taking different computer programming courses. The bars are different heights because the total number of students increases over time.

![](images/433b3da038388b8e953d5d888b1cbaafdc7a091f6045d96550515c2495e3b962.jpg)

# TIP

Each colour section represents a share of the whole. You have to work out what that share is by counting along the scale from the start of each colour.

In 2019, 100 students enrolled in the Algorithms course. By 2022, this had increased to 290 students. In 2020, 100 students chose Web Development. This is an increase of 30 from the 70 students enrolled in that course in 2019.

HIV remains a global health issue, but it is now classified as an epidemic rather than a pandemic. In 2021, the organisation Avert reported that 37.7 million people worldwide were living with HIV. The vast majority of these people live in low- and middle-income countries. The countries of East and Southern Africa are the most affected by this disease and 20.6 million people in these countries are living with HIV. There has been an overall decrease in the rate of new infections in this region, largely due to awareness and education campaigns and the introduction of anti-retroviral medication on a large scale.

# PEER ASSESSMENT

How can you decide whether another student's bar chart is correct or not?

One way of assessing a piece of work is to write a checklist. A checklist is an assessment tool. It is a list of statements that give the criteria you will use to measure skills or student success in a particular area. The answer to each statement is either 'yes' or 'no', or 'done' or 'not done'.

1 Work in small groups to write a checklist to assess whether someone can draw an accurate and clear bar chart.

Consider the learning outcomes for this work and what you have covered in the lessons.  
- Your statements should be clear, specific and easy to check. For example: The chart has a clear heading [ ] yes [ ] no  
Leave space in your checklist to add comments. For example: Your heading has spelling mistakes in it. or The vertical scale needs to start at 0.

2 Use your checklist to assess another student's completed work in Exercise 4.8.  
3 Use the checklist to suggest corrections, improvements or learning goals that still need to be met.

# MATHEMATICAL CONNECTIONS

Look at the earlier sections of this chapter to remind yourself about grouped frequency tables if you need to.

# REFLECTION

Think about your own academic performance as you worked through the material on bar charts and answer these questions.

What new things did you learn? Why are these important?  
- Were the strategies, skills and procedures that you knew or learned useful for completing the exercises? Explain why or why not.  
Did you come to each lesson prepared to learn? (Think about your attitude and the equipment you needed to bring.)  
- Which activities helped you to learn the most? Why?  
Did you experience any difficulty or frustration in this work? What did you do about it?

# Pie charts

A pie chart uses slices or sectors of a circle to show data. The circle represents the 'whole' set of data. For example, if you survey the favourite sports played by everyone in a school then the total number of students is represented by the circle. The sectors represent groups of students who prefer each sport.

Like other charts, pie charts should have a heading and a key.

# WORKED EXAMPLE 6

The table shows how a student spent one day.

<table><tr><td>Activity</td><td>School</td><td>Sleeping</td><td>Eating</td><td>Online</td><td>On the phone</td><td>Complaining about stuff</td></tr><tr><td>Number of hours</td><td>7</td><td>8</td><td>1.5</td><td>3</td><td>2.5</td><td>2</td></tr></table>

Draw a pie chart to show this data.

$7 + 8 + 1.5 + 3 + 2.5 + 2 = 24$  First work out the total number of hours.

Then work out each category as a fraction of the whole and convert the fraction to degrees:

<table><tr><td></td><td>(as a fraction of 24)</td><td>(convert to degrees)</td></tr><tr><td>School</td><td>= 7/24</td><td>= 7/24 × 360 = 105°</td></tr><tr><td>Sleeping</td><td>= 8/24</td><td>8/24 × 360 = 120°</td></tr><tr><td>Eating</td><td>= 1.5/24 = 15/240</td><td>15/240 × 360 = 22.5°</td></tr><tr><td>Online</td><td>= 3/24</td><td>3/24 × 360 = 45°</td></tr><tr><td>On the phone</td><td>= 2.5/24 = 25/240</td><td>25/240 × 360 = 37.5°</td></tr><tr><td>Complaining about stuff</td><td>= 2/24</td><td>2/24 × 360 = 30°</td></tr></table>

A student's day

# TIP

It is possible that your angles, once rounded, don't quite add up to  $360^{\circ}$ . If this happens, you can add or subtract a degree to or from the largest sector (the one with the highest frequency).

# WORKED EXAMPLE 7

a What fraction of the day did Javi spend playing computer games?  
b How much time did Javi spend sleeping?  
c What do you think 'other stuff' involved?

# Answers

a  $\frac{120}{360} = \frac{1}{3}$

Measure the angle and convert it to a fraction. The yellow sector has an angle of  $120^{\circ}$ . Convert to a fraction by writing it over 360 and simplify.

b  $\frac{210}{360} \times 24 = 14$  hours  
Measure the angle, convert it to hours.  
c Things Javi didn't bother to list. Possibly eating, showering, getting dressed.

You will think about graphs that can be used for converting currencies or systems of units in Chapter 13. You will deal with graphs showing time, distance and speed in Chapter 21.

# Line graphs

# INVESTIGATION

# Graphs can tell a story

Line graphs show changes over time.

11 Look at this generalised graph of noise levels in a classroom during a lesson.

How does the shape of the graph and the slope of the lines tell a story even though there are no scales given on the axes?

![](images/2a9a0aabc2fa98c8ddb503b5282c272d1c4dc92021704fbe8f19b8d4ffc6b757.jpg)

3 What would your happiness graph look like for a normal school day? Draw it and add notes giving the reasons or events that caused any changes in the graph.

Some data that you collect varies over time. For example, the average temperature each month of the year, the number of cars each hour that park in a supermarket car park or the amount of money in your bank account each week.

This line graph shows how the depth of water in a garden pond varies over a year. The graph shows that the water level is at its lowest between June and August.

Sea nettle jellyfish bodies on the previous page are  $\frac{1}{20}$  protein, muscles and nerve cells - the rest is water. Work out what percentage of a jellyfish's body is water.

We use fractions and percentages on an almost daily basis, often without realising it. For example, we use fractions to answer questions like these:

How far can you travel on half a tank of petrol?  
If you share  $\frac{3}{4}$  of a cake between two people, how much will they each get?  
If three-fifths of a  $100\mathrm{km}$  journey is complete, how far do you still have to travel?

# 5.1 Revisiting fractions

A fraction tells you what share or part of a whole amount you are working with. For example,  $\frac{1}{2}$  of a pie means 1 of 2 equal parts of the pie and  $\frac{7}{8}$  of the students means 7 out of every 8 students. The mixed number  $\frac{2\frac{3}{4}}{4}$  means you are working with 2 wholes and 3 of 4 parts of another whole.

Proper fractions are written in the form  $\frac{a}{b}$  where  $a > b$ . The number on the top,  $a$ , can be any number and is called the numerator. The number on the bottom,  $b$ , can be any number except 0 and is called the denominator.

When you multiply or divide both the numerator and the denominator by the same number you get a new fraction that has the same value as the original fraction. The new fraction is called an equivalent fraction.

For example,  $\frac{2}{3} = \frac{2 \times 4}{3 \times 4} = \frac{8}{12}$  and  $\frac{25}{35} = \frac{25 \div 5}{35 \div 5} = \frac{5}{7}$ .

Notice in the second example that the original fraction  $\left(\frac{25}{35}\right)$  was divided rather than multiplied to get  $\frac{5}{7}$ . The numbers 5 and 7 have no common factor other than 1 so the fraction cannot be divided any further. This means that  $\frac{25}{35}$  is now in its simplest form as  $\frac{5}{7}$ . This is sometimes called the lowest terms.

# MATHEMATICAL CONNECTIONS

Before you work through this section remind yourself about highest common factors (HCFs) in Chapter 1, but remember you can multiply or divide by any factor to make equivalent fractions, it does not have to be the HCF.

# WORKED EXAMPLE 1

Express each fraction in its simplest form.

a 3 15

b 16 24

21 28

5 d 8

# Answers

3 3÷3 15 15+3 5

16 16+8 2 b 24 24+8 3

21+7 3 28+7 4

d  $\frac{5}{8}$  is already in its simplest form

(5 and 8 have no common factors other than 1).

# TIP

Notice that in each case you divide the numerator and the denominator by their HCF.

# TIP

Fractions were originally written with a slant line like this: 2/5. You will often find fractions written like this and when you enter fractions online you type them like that.

# TIP

Remember, dividing the numerator and denominator by the same number simplifies the fraction.

# WORKED EXAMPLE 2

Which two of  $\frac{5}{6}, \frac{20}{25}$  and  $\frac{15}{18}$  are equivalent fractions?

# Answer

5 is already in its simplest form.

# Alternative method

Simplify each of the other fractions:

You could have written:

$$
\frac {2 0}{2 5} = \frac {2 0 + 5}{2 5 + 5} = \frac {4}{5}
$$

$$
\frac {5 1 8}{1 8} = \frac {5}{6}
$$

$$
\frac {1 5}{1 8} = \frac {1 5 \div 3}{1 8 \div 3} = \frac {5}{6}
$$

This is called cancelling and is a shorter way of showing what you have done.

So  $\frac{5}{6}$  and  $\frac{15}{18}$  are equivalent.

# Multiplying fractions

To multiply two or more fractions, multiply the numerators and then multiply the denominators. Sometimes you will need to simplify your answer.

b  $\frac{5}{7}\times 3$

Answers

a  $\frac{3}{4} \times \frac{2}{7} = \frac{3 \times 2}{4 \times 7} = \frac{6}{28} = \frac{3}{14}$

Another method is to cancel before multiplying:

$$
\frac {3}{2 4} \times \frac {2}{7} = \frac {3 \times 1}{2 \times 7} = \frac {3}{1 4}
$$

b  $\frac{5}{7} \times 3 = \frac{5 \times 3}{7 \times 1} = \frac{15}{7}$

3 of 4 1 3 3 2 16

Multiply the numerators to get the new numerator value. Do the same with the denominators. Then express the fraction in its simplest form.

Divide the denominator of the first fraction, and the numerator of the second fraction, by two.

15 and 7 do not have a common factor other than 1 and so cannot be simplified.

You need to change the mixed number to an improper fraction. This allows you to complete the multiplication. Notice that the word 'of' is replaced with the  $\times$  sign.

# TIP

To multiply a fraction by an integer you only multiply the numerator by the integer.

For example,

$$
\frac {5}{7} \times 3 = \frac {5 \times 3}{7} = \frac {1 5}{7}.
$$

# TIP

An improper fraction is a fraction where the numerator is larger than the denominator. To change a mixed number to a common fraction, multiply the whole number part (in this case 4) by the denominator and add it to the numerator. So:

$$
4 \frac {1}{2} = \frac {4 \times 2 + 1}{2} = \frac {9}{2}.
$$

# Fraction patterns

1 You can convert any fraction to a decimal number using your calculator. For example, if you work out  $\frac{1}{2}$  as a decimal by dividing 1 by 2 you will get the decimal 0.5.

Try converting the following fractions to decimals:

2 5

3 7

4 9

3 16

2 Which fractions in question 1 stop ('terminate') after a few decimal places and which seem to go on forever? Try some more fractions and decide which of these two groups they fall into.  
3 Look at the dominators of the fractions that with decimals that terminate. What do they have in common? [Hint: what are the factors of the denominator each time?]  
4 Now work out the decimals for:

1

4 7

5 7

Do the answers have anything in common?

Try the same thing with denominator 11. What about 13?

Explain any patterns that you see.

# TIP

Remember to use the correct order of operations (BODMAS) here.

# MATHEMATICAL CONNECTIONS

You will revisit multiplication, division, addition and subtraction of fractions in Chapter 14 when you deal with algebraic fractions.

# Dividing fractions

To divide one fraction by another, you multiply the first fraction by the reciprocal of the second fraction.

To find the reciprocal of a fraction you invert it. So, the reciprocal of  $\frac{3}{4}$  is  $\frac{4}{3}$  and the reciprocal of  $\frac{7}{2}$  is  $\frac{2}{7}$ .

The reciprocal of  $\frac{1}{2}$  is  $\frac{2}{1}$  or just 2 and the reciprocal of 5 is  $\frac{1}{5}$ .

When you multiply a fraction by its reciprocal the result is always 1. For example:

$$
\frac {1}{3} \times \frac {3}{1} = 1, \quad \frac {3}{8} \times \frac {8}{3} = 1 \quad \text {a n d} \quad \frac {a}{b} \times \frac {b}{a} = 1.
$$

Look at the example below to understand why this method works.

$$
\frac {5}{1 1} \div \frac {1}{2} = \frac {\frac {5}{1 1}}{\frac {1}{2}}
$$

To get rid of the fraction  $\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)$  in the denominator, multiply both the numerator and denominator by 2.

$$
\frac {5}{1 1} \div \frac {1}{2} = \frac {\frac {5}{1 1} \times \frac {2}{1}}{\frac {1}{2} \times \frac {2}{1}} = \frac {\frac {1 0}{1 1}}{1} = \frac {1 0}{1 1}
$$

If you invert the fraction you are dividing by and multiply, you will give the same answer with fewer steps:

$$
\frac {5}{1 1} \div \frac {1}{2} = \frac {5}{1 1} \times \frac {2}{1} = \frac {1 0}{1 1}
$$

# Fractions with decimals

In some calculations either the numerator or the denominator, or both, might not be whole numbers. To express these fractions in their simplest forms:

- find an equivalent fraction where both the numerator and denominator are integers  
- check that the equivalent fraction is in its simplest form.

# WORKED EXAMPLE 8

of the students in a school do not wear glasses. If 360 students do not wear glasses, how many students are there in the whole school?

Answer

$\frac{2}{5}$  of the total is 360, so  $\frac{1}{5}$  of the total must be half of this, 180.

This means that the total  $\left(\frac{5}{5}\right)$  is  $5 \times 180 = 900$  students altogether.

# 5.3 Percentages

Per cent means 'out of a hundred'. The percentage  $40\%$  means '40 out of every hundred'. You can see in the diagram that this is equivalent to 4 out of ten people:

$$
\frac{4}{10} = \frac{40}{100} = 40\%
$$

![](images/477270913bbc11545dd120ca083f006eddb9f0202bd17335b1a27b859d0f21d2.jpg)

# LINK

Percentages are often used in daily life and the media. You may see signs in shops offering '25% off' or adverts that claim '90% of cats prefer a particular brand of food' or '80% of people using a skin product claimed an improvement in 30 days'. Some percentages may be greater than 100%. For example, drinking two glasses of juice could provide 120% of your daily Vitamin C requirements.

Statistics in the media are often given as percentages to make them easier to understand. For example, a country may report that  $80\%$  of adults have been fully vaccinated against a disease. However, using percentages can also be misleading.  $60\%$  of people in a survey could be 3 million out of 5 million people or 3 out of 5 people. When actual numbers are used to report statistics, it may be because the percentages do not sound dramatic enough. For example, a news report may say that 300000 people countrywide have had their power cut off due to supply problems. In a country of 65 million people this is less than half a percent  $(0.46\%)$  and if the population is 85 million this is just over  $\frac{1}{3}$  of a percent  $(0.35\%)$ .

# Equivalent percentages, fractions and decimals

Percentages, fractions and decimals are all ways of representing part of a whole.

To convert a percentage into a decimal, divide by 100. So,  $45\% = \frac{45}{100} = 0.45$  and  $3.1\% = \frac{3.1}{100} = 0.031$ . (Notice that the digits move two places to the right.)

To convert a decimal to a percentage, multiply by 100. So,  $0.65 = \frac{65}{100} = 65\%$  and  $0.7 \times 100 = 70\%$ . (Notice that the digits move two places to the left.)

To convert a percentage to a fraction, write the fraction with a denominator of 100 and simplify.

# WORKED EXAMPLE 9

# Percentage increases and decreases

The cost of a book increases from  $12 to$ 15. The actual increase is  $3. As a fraction of the original value, the increase is \frac{3}{12} = \frac{1}{4}$ . This is the fractional change and you can write this fraction as  $25\%$ . In this example, the value of the book increased by  $25\%$  of the original value. This is called the percentage increase. If the value reduces (for example if something is on sale in a shop) then it is a percentage decrease.

# TIP

When increases or decreases are stated as percentages, they are always stated as percentages of the original value.

# WORKED EXAMPLE 13

The value of a house increased from  $120000 to$ 124800 between August and December. What percentage increase is this?

# Answer

$$
\$ 124800 - \$ 120000 = \$ 4800
$$

First calculate the increase.

$$
\% \text {increase} = \frac {\text {increase}}{\text {original}} \times 100 \%
$$

Write the increase as a fraction of the original and multiply by 100.

$$
= \frac{4800}{120000}\times 100\%
$$

Then do the calculation (either in your head or using a calculator).

$$
= 4 \%

6 A liquid evaporates steadily. In one hour the mass of liquid in a container decreases from  $0.32\mathrm{kg}$  to  $0.18\mathrm{kg}$ . Calculate the percentage decrease.

# Increasing and decreasing by a given percentage

If you know what percentage you want to increase or decrease an amount by, you can find the actual increase or decrease by finding a percentage of the original. If you want to know the new value, you either add the increase to, or subtract the decrease from, the original value.

You can also use a multiplier to increase or decrease amounts. An increase of  $5\%$  means you will end up with  $105\%$ . This is equivalent to  $\frac{105}{100} = 1.05$ , so you can multiply by 1.05 to work out the increased amount. A decrease of  $5\%$  will leave you with  $95\%$ . This is equivalent to  $\frac{95}{100} = 0.95$  and you can use this to calculate the decreased amount.

# WORKED EXAMPLE 14

To increase the original by  $10\%$  add this to 56.

c  $1.04\times 56 = 58.24$

A  $15\%$  increase means  $115\%$  of the original.

$$
115\% = 1.15

A  $4\%$  increase means  $104\%$  of the original.

$$
104 \% = 1.04
$$

# TIP

Remember that you are always considering a percentage of the original value.

# WORKED EXAMPLE 15

In a sale all items are reduced by  $15\%$ . If the normal price for a bicycle is $120, calculate the sale price.

# Answer

$$
100\% -15\% = 85\%
$$

Reducing a number by  $15\%$  leaves you with  $85\%$  of the original. So, find  $85\%$  of the original value.

$$
\frac {8 5}{1 0 0} \times \$ 1 2 0 = \$ 1 0 2
$$

85% is equivalent to  $\frac{85}{100} = 0.85$

Or use a multiplier:

$$
0. 8 5 \times \$ 1 2 0 = 1 0 2

\(100\% = \\)70\( and you need to find \(75\%\).

$$
1 \% = \frac {\mathbb {S} 7 0}{1 0 0} = \mathbb {S} 0. 7
$$

Divide $70 by 100 to find 1%

$$
75 \% = \\( 0.7 \times 75 = \\) 52.50

# Reverse percentages

Sometimes you are given the value or amount of an item after a percentage increase or decrease and you need to work out what the original value was. To solve these reverse percentage questions, it is important to remember that you are always dealing with percentages of the original values.

# WORKED EXAMPLE 17

A store is holding a sale in which every item is reduced by  $10\%$ . A jacket in this sale is sold for $108.

Calculate the original price of the jacket.

# Answer

\(\frac{90}{100} \times x = 108\) The new cost is \(90\%\) of the original.  
\(x = \frac{100}{90} \times 108\) To solve for \(x\), multiply both sides of the equation by Original price \(= \\)120\) the reciprocal of \(\frac{90}{100}\).

It is important to remember that undoing a  $10\%$  decrease is not the same as increasing the reduced value by  $10\%$ . If you increase the sale price of  $108$  by  $10\%$  you will get  $\frac{110}{100} \times \$108 = \$118.80$ , which is a different (and incorrect) answer.

You can use a bar model to help you with reverse percentage calculations.

# WORKED EXAMPLE 18

A shop advertises a laptop for sale for \(320 during a \(20 \%\)off sale. What was the original price of the laptop?

# Answer

![](images/6fbcec285db2eebb31934ad20a80be77984935ac09cfb7fa3c974ac92fe79323.jpg)

Draw a bar model.

20% has been taken off, so $320 is 80% of the original cost.

$$
1 \% = \frac {\mathbb {S} 320}{80} = \mathbb {S} 4
$$

$$
100 \% = \$ 4 \times 100 = \$ 400
$$

Divide $320 by 80 to find 1%

Multiply $4 by 100 to find 100%

# Exercise 5.11

# 5.4 Standard form

There are an estimated 10000000000000000000000000 stars in the universe.  
The star Betelgeuse has a mass of 218800000000000000000000000000000 kg.  
A single carbon atom has a mass of 0.000000000000000000000000000000199kg.

It is clumsy and impractical to write out very large and very small numbers like this. You might make mistakes and add or miss out zeros in calculations. We use standard form to express very small and very large numbers as a number multiplied by a power of 10.

# LINK

Very small and very large numbers occur often in chemistry; the carbon atom mass, given here, is just one example. The reason this happens a lot is because the subject usually deals with very small objects in very large numbers.

# TIP

Standard form is also called scientific notation or exponential notation.

# Writing numbers in standard form

You can write any number in standard form by writing it as a number between 1 and 10 multiplied by a suitable power of 10. In algebraic language we say that any number can be written in the form  $A \times 10^n$ , where  $1 \leq A < 10$  and  $n$  is an integer.

The numbers at the start of this section can be written in standard form as  $1 \times 10^{24}$ ,  $2.188 \times 10^{31}$  and  $1.99 \times 10^{-26}$ .

When a number is in standard form, the index (power of 10) tells you how many places the digits have moved and whether they have moved to the right or left.

# WORKED EXAMPLE 19

Write 320000 in standard form.

# Answer

3.2

![](images/0778d4feeafc62ec947d4ef04174d0e6077b287f1957717e7f5cbf1203d4305a.jpg)

Write the number with the decimal point after the first non-zero digit to get a number between 1 and 10.

Work out how many places the first digit needs to move to get back to its original place. In this case, the 3 needs to move five places to the left to get back to its original hundred thousands position.

$320000 = 3.2 \times 10^{5}$

Work out the index (power of 10). In this case, the original number is bigger than 3.2 so the index will be positive.

In other words, to move the digit 3 back to its original position you would need to multiply by 105.

# WORKED EXAMPLE 20

1 Write each of the following numbers in standard form.

a 0.004

b 0.00000034

# Answers

a

![](images/0f8f19dec566363cffaac25ee7d6450dea87f14cd518d3ef8b1dba7090b616a6.jpg)

0.004

4.0

$= 4\times 10^{-3}$

Start with a number between 1 and 10, in this case 4.

Compare the position of the first digit: '4' needs to move three places to the right to get from the new number to the original number. In Worked example 19 you saw that moving five places to the left meant multiplying by  $10^{5}$ , so moving three places to the right means multiply by  $10^{-3}$ .

Notice also that the first non-zero digit in 0.004 is in the 3rd place after the decimal point and that the power of 10 is -3.

b

0.00000034=3.4÷107

$= 3.4\times 10^{-7}$

![](images/8b976921fee8031ba438ff911325b9e3d00b5e9de04ead6f13c05686a2701cd7.jpg)

0000000034=3.4×10-7

The first non-zero digit in 0.00000034 is in the 7th place after the decimal point so the power of 10 is -7.

# Calculating in standard form without a calculator

Sometimes you may have to perform calculations using numbers written in standard form without using your calculator.

# Multiplying and dividing

When numbers are written in standard form you can use the laws of indices to multiply and divide them without using a calculator.

# MATHEMATICAL CONNECTIONS

The laws of indices are covered in Chapter 1 and revisited in Chapter 2.

# WORKED EXAMPLE 21

Write each of the following in standard form.

a  $(3\times 10^{5})\times (2\times 10^{6})$

$$

$$
= 6 \times 1 0 ^ {1 1}
$$

Rearrange the calculation.

Use the laws of indices where appropriate.

Write the number in standard form.

You may be asked to convert your answer to an ordinary number.

To convert  $6 \times 1011$  into an ordinary number, the  $6'$  needs to move 11 places to the left:

$$
6. 0 \times 1 0 ^ {1 1}
$$

$$
= 6 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
$$

b  $(2\times 10^{3})\times (8\times 10^{7}) = (2\times 8)\times (10^{3}\times 10^{7})$

$$
= 1 6 \times 1 0 ^ {1 0}
$$

$$
\begin{array}{l} 1 6 \times 1 0 ^ {1 0} = 1. 6 \times 1 0 \times 1 0 ^ {1 0} \\ = 1. 6 \times 1 0 ^ {1 1} \\ \end{array}
$$

The answer  $16 \times 10^{10}$  is numerically correct but it is not in standard form because 16 is not between 1 and 10.

You can change it to standard form by thinking of 16 as  $1.6 \times 10$ .

c  $(2.8\times 10^{6})\div (1.4\times 10^{4}) = \frac{2.8\times 10^{6}}{1.4\times 10^{4}}$

$$
\begin{array}{l} = \frac {2 . 8}{1 . 4} \times \frac {1 0 ^ {6}}{1 0 ^ {4}} \\ = 2 \times 1 0 ^ {6 - 4} \\ = 2 \times 1 0 ^ {2} \\ \end{array}
$$

Subtract the indices to divide the powers.

# Adding and subtracting

In Chapter 2 you learned that you can add and subtract like terms. In standard form, like terms are identical powers of 10. For example,  $1.2 \times 10^{3}$  and  $3 \times 10^{3}$  are like terms and you can add them to get  $4.2 \times 10^{3}$ .

The numbers  $9 \times 10^6$  and  $3 \times 10^8$  have different powers of 10, so these are not like terms and you cannot simply add them. Instead you can manipulate the expressions to make like terms. For example, you can write  $3 \times 10^8$  as  $3 \times 10^6 \times 10^2$  (because  $10^6 \times 10^2 = 10^8$ ) and then you can write this as  $300 \times 10^6$  and add it to  $9 \times 10^6$ .

# TIP

If you are using a calculator you don't need to manipulate the expressions. You just enter the calculation correctly to get the answer.

# WORKED EXAMPLE 22

# 6.1 Solving equations

I think of a number, x. If I multiply my number by three and then add one, the answer is 13. What is my number?

To solve this problem you need to understand what is happening to  $x$  and then undo the operations in reverse order. This diagram (sometimes called a function machine) shows what is happening to  $x$ , with the reverse process written underneath. Notice how the answer to the problem appears quite easily:

![](images/f21f13a6577d5728fc7fca3888506652045eb9f24d6a61203c9fc6242a0cb521.jpg)

# MATHEMATICAL CONNECTIONS

The order of operations is very important here. You learnt about this in Chapter 1 and you can use the word BODMAS to help you remember the correct order.

You can reach the solution more efficiently using algebra. Follow the instructions in the question:

<table><tr><td>1</td><td>The number is x:</td><td>x</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>Multiply this number by three:</td><td>3x</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>Then add one:</td><td>3x+1</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>The answer is 13:</td><td>3x+1=13</td></tr></table>

This is called a linear equation 'Linear' means there are no powers of  $x$  other than one.

# LINK

Accounting uses a lot of mathematics. Accountants use computer spreadsheets to calculate and analyse financial data. Although the programs do the calculations, the user has to know which equations and formulae to insert to tell the program what to do. Most computer systems use the same rules for the order of operations.

# MATHEMATICAL CONNECTIONS

You will study equations of straight lines in Chapter 10. Any equation in the form  $y = mx + c$  is the equation of a straight line. This is why equations involving only the first power of  $x$  and constants are known as linear equations.

You can change the way an equation is written without changing the solution (the value of  $x$  for which the equation is true), as long as you do the same thing to both sides of the equation at the same time.

Follow the reverse process shown in the function machine on the previous page but carry out the instruction on both sides of the equation:

$$
3 x + 1 = 1 3
$$

$$
\begin{array}{l} 3 x + 1 - 1 = 1 3 - 1 \quad \text {(s u b t r a c t o n e f r o m b o t h s i d e s)} \\ 3 x = 1 2 \\ \frac {3 x}{3} = \frac {1 2}{3} \quad \text {(d i v i d e b o t h s i d e s b y t h r e e)} \\ x = 4 \\ \end{array}
$$

# TIP

Even if you can see what the solution is going to be easily you must show working.

Sometimes linear equations contain brackets, and sometimes they can also have unknown values (like  $x$ , though you can use any letter or symbol) on both sides of the equals sign.

Worked example 1 shows you how to solve some different types of linear equations.

# TIP

Always line up the  ${}^{\prime} = {}^{\prime}$  signs because this makes your working much clearer.

# WORKED EXAMPLE 1

An equation with  $x$  on both sides and all  $x$  terms with the same sign:

a Solve the equation  $5x - 2 = 3x + 6$

# Answer

$$
5 x - 2 = 3 x + 6
$$

$$
5 x - 2 - 3 x = 3 x + 6 - 3 x
$$

$$
2 x - 2 = 6
$$

$$
2 x - 2 + 2 = 6 + 2
$$

$$
2 x = 8
$$

$$
\frac {2 x}{2} = \frac {8}{2}
$$

$$
x = 4
$$

Subtract  $3x$  from both sides.

Add 2 to both sides.

Divide both sides by 2.

An equation with  $x$  on both sides and  $x$  terms with different signs:

b Solve the equation  $5x + 12 = 20 - 11x$

# Answer

$$
5 x + 1 2 = 2 0 - 1 1 x
$$

$$
5 x + 1 2 + 1 1 x = 2 0 - 1 1 x + 1 1 x
$$

$$
1 6 x + 1 2 = 2 0
$$

$$
1 6 x + 1 2 - 1 2 = 2 0 - 1 2
$$

$$
1 6 x = 8
$$

$$
\frac {1 6 x}{1 6} = \frac {8}{1 6}
$$

$$
x = \frac {1}{2}
$$

This time add  $11x$  to both sides, so you have a positive number of  $x$ 's

Subtract 12 from both sides.

Divide both sides by 16.

An equation with brackets on at least one side:

c Solve the equation  $2(y - 4) + 4(y + 2) = 30$

# Answer

$$
2 y - 8 + 4 y + 8 = 3 0
$$

$$
6 y = 3 0
$$

$$
\frac {6 y}{6} = \frac {3 0}{6}
$$

$$
y = 5
$$

Expand the brackets.

Collect like terms.

Divide both sides by 6.

An equation that contains fractions:

d Solve the equation  $\frac{6}{7} p = 10$

# Answer

$$
\frac {6}{7} p \times 7 = 1 0 \times 7
$$

$$
6 p = 7 0
$$

$$
\frac {6 p}{6} = \frac {7 0}{6}
$$

$$
p = \frac {3 5}{3}
$$

Multiply both sides by 7.

Divide both sides by 6.

Write the fraction in its simplest form.

# TIP

You could subtract  $5x$  from both sides instead, but this gives a negative coefficient of  $x$  which is clumsy to work with.

# TIP

Unless the question asks you to give your answer to a specific degree of accuracy, you should leave it as a fraction.

# WORKED EXAMPLE 1 CONTINUED

An equation with fractions and variables in the denominators

e Solve the equation  $\frac{2}{3} + \frac{1}{3x} = \frac{4 - x}{6x}$

# Answer

$$
6 x \left(\frac {2}{3} + \frac {1}{3 x}\right) = 6 x \left(\frac {4 - x}{6 x}\right)
$$

$$
4 x + 2 = 4 - x
$$

$$
4 x + x = 4 - 2
$$

$$
5 x = 2
$$

$$
x = \frac {2}{5}
$$

The lowest common denominator is  $6x$ , so multiply both sides by  $6x$ .

Collect  $x$  terms on one side and numbers on the other.

Divide both sides by 5.

Leave your answer as a fraction.

# MATHEMATICAL CONNECTIONS

You will deal with equations that have expressions containing unknowns in the denominator again in Chapter 10 and Chapter 14.

Some equations have an expression with  $x$  as the power. These types of equations are called exponential equations.

# WORKED EXAMPLE 2

Solve each equation to find the value of  $x$ .

a  $3^{3x + 1} = 81$

b  $32^{\times} = 2$

c  $3^{x + 1} = 9^{x}$

# Answers

a  $3^{3x + 1} = 81$

Notice that 81 is the 4th power of 3.

$$
3 ^ {3 x + 1} = 3 ^ {4}
$$

$$
3 x + 1 = 4
$$

The powers must be the same.

$$
3 x = 3
$$

Subtract 1 from both sides.

$$
x = 1
$$

Divide both sides by 3.

b (25)×=21

Write both terms as powers of 2.

$$
2 ^ {5 x} = 2 ^ {1}
$$

Remove the brackets using the index laws.

$$
5 x = 1
$$

Equate the indices.

$$
x = \frac {1}{5}
$$

Solve for  $x$ .

c  $3^{x + 1} = (3^{2})^{x}$

Write both terms with the same base (as powers of 3).

$$
3 ^ {x + 1} = 3 ^ {2 x}
$$

Remove the brackets using the index laws.

$$
x + 1 = 2 x
$$

Equate the indices.

$$
x = 1
$$

Solve for  $x$ .

# TIP

# 6.2 Factorising algebraic expressions

You have already learnt how to expand brackets to simplify expressions and solve equations. It can sometimes be helpful to carry out the opposite process and put brackets back into an algebraic expression.

Consider the algebraic expression  $12x - 4$ . This expression is already simplified, but notice that 12 and 4 have a common factor. In fact the highest common factor (HCF) of 12 and 4 is 4.

Now,  $12 = 4 \times 3$  and  $4 = 4 \times 1$ .

So,  $12x - 4 = 4 \times 3x - 4 \times 1$

$$
= 4 (3 x - 1)
$$

Notice that the HCF has been 'taken out' of the bracket and written at the front. You find the terms inside by considering what you need to multiply by 4 to get  $12x$  and  $-4$ .

The process of writing an algebraic expression using brackets in this way is called factorisation. The expression  $12x - 4$  has been factorised to give  $4(3x - 1)$ .

Worked example 3 shows some factorisations that are not quite so simple.

# WORKED EXAMPLE 3

Factorise each of the following expressions as fully as possible.

a  $15x + 12y$

b 18mn-30m

c  $36p^{2}q - 24pq^{2}$

d  $15(x - 2) - 20(x - 2)^{3}$

e  $6bx - 15cx + 10cy - 4by$

f ax + by + atx + bty

# Answers

a  $15x + 12y$

The HCF of 12 and 15 is 3, but  $x$  and  $y$  have no common factors.

${15x} + {12y} = 3\left( {{5x} + {4y}}\right)$

Because  $3 \times 5x = 15x$  and  $3 \times 4y = 12y$

b 18mn-30m

The HCF of 18 and  $30 = 6$  and the HCF of  $mn$  and  $m$  is  $m$ .

$$
1 8 m n - 3 0 m = 6 m (3 n - 5)
$$

Because  $6m \times 3n = 18mn$  and  $6m \times -5 = -30m$ .

36p²q-24pq²

The HCF of 36 and  $24 = 12$  and  $p^2 q$  and  $pq^2$  have common factor  $pq$ .

$$
3 6 p ^ {2} q - 2 4 p q ^ {2} = 1 2 p q (3 p - 2 q)
$$

Because  $12pq \times 3p = 36p^2q$  and  $12pq \times -2q = -24pq^2$ .

Sometimes, the terms can have an expression in brackets that is common to both terms.

d  $15(x - 2) - 20(x - 2)^{3}$

The HCF of 15 and 20 is 5 and the HCF of  $(x - 2)$  and  $(x - 2)^{3}$  is  $(x - 2)$

Because  $5(x - 2) \times 3 = 15(x - 2)$  and  $5(x - 2) \times 4(x - 2)^2 = 20(x - 2)^3$ .

$$
\begin{array}{l} 1 5 (x - 2) - 2 0 (x - 2) ^ {3} \\ 1 5 (x - 2) - 2 0 (x - 2) ^ {3} \\ = 5 (x - 2) [ 3 - 4 (x - 2) ^ {2} ] \\ \end{array}
$$

# MATHEMATICAL CONNECTIONS

You learnt how to find HCFs in Chapter 1.

# TIP

Make sure that you have taken out all the common factors (the highest common factor). If you don't, then your algebraic expression is not fully factorised.

# TIP

Take care to put in all the bracket symbols.

# WORKED EXAMPLE 3 CONTINUED

You also need to be able to factorise expressions in the form

$$
a x + b x + k a y + k b y.
$$

You can do this by collecting like terms and factorising the  $x$  and the  $y$  terms separately.

e 6bx-15cx+10cy-4by

$$
\begin{array}{l} = (6 b x - 1 5 c x) + (1 0 c y - 4 b y) \quad \text {C o l l e c t} \\ = 3 x (2 b - 5 c) + 2 y (5 c - 2 b) \quad \text {F a c t o r i s e} x \text {a n d} y \text {t e r m s s e p a r a t e l y .} \\ = 3 x (2 b - 5 c) - 2 y (2 b - 5 c) \quad \text {T a k e a c o m m o n f a c t o r o f - 1 . T h e b r a c k e t} \\ = (2 b - 5 c) (3 x - 2 y) \quad (2 b - 5 c) \text {i s h o w a c o m m e n t i f a t i o n} \\ \end{array}
$$

f ax + by + atx + bty  
$= ax + atx + by + bty$  Collect like terms and factorise the  $x$  and  $y$  terms separately.  
$= ax(1 + t) + by(1 + t)$  The HCF of ax and atx is ax and the HCF of by and bty is by.  
$= (ax + by)(1 + t)$  The bracket  $(1 + t)$  is a common factor.

6 Investigate this further by trying different numbers of consecutive integers.

# 6.3 Rearranging formulae

Formulae are very often expressed with one variable written alone on one side of the  $=$ ' symbol (usually on the left but not always). The variable that is written alone is called the subject of the formula. For example:

$$
\begin{array}{l} s = u t + \frac {1}{2} a t ^ {2} \quad (s \text {i s t h e s u b j e c t}) \\ F = m a \quad (F \text {i s t h e s u b j e c t}) \\ x = \frac {- b \pm \sqrt {b ^ {2} - 4 a c}}{2 a} \quad (x \text {i s t h e s u b j e c t}) \\ \end{array}
$$

Sometimes it is more helpful to have a different variable as the subject so you need to know how to change the subject of a formula. In the formula  $\nu = u + at$  the subject is currently  $\nu$ , but you can change the subject by rearranging the formula.

For example, to make  $a$  the subject of this formula:

$\nu = u + at$  Write down the starting formula.

$v - u = at$  Subtract  $u$  from both sides (to isolate the term containing  $a$

$\frac{v - u}{t} = a$  Divide both sides by  $t$  (notice that everything on the left is divided by  $t$ ).

You now have  $a$  on its own and so now  $a$  is the subject of the formula.

Usually we rewrite this so the subject is on the left:

$$
a = \frac {v - u}{t}
$$

Notice how similar this process is to solving equations.

Make the variable shown in brackets the subject of the formula in each case.

# WORKED EXAMPLE 4

a  $x + y = c(y)$

a-b d (b)

c  $\sqrt{x} +y = z(x)$

# Answers

a  $x + y = c$

$$
\Rightarrow y = c - x
$$

Subtract  $x$  from both sides.

b  $\frac{a - b}{c} = d$

$\Rightarrow a - b = cd$  Multiply both sides by c to clear the fraction.  
$\Rightarrow a = cd + b$  Make the number of  $b$  's positive by adding  $b$  to both sides.  
So  $b = a - cd$  Subtract cd from both sides.

Rewrite so the subject is on the left.

c x+y=2

$\Rightarrow \sqrt{x} = z - y$  Subtractyfromboth sides  
$\Rightarrow x = (z - y)^2$  Square both sides.

# MATHEMATICAL CONNECTIONS

You will learn more about rearranging formulae in Chapter 22.

# TIP

Another word sometimes used for changing the subject is 'transposing'.

# TIP

Remember that you must always do the same thing to both sides of a formula. This ensures that the formula you produce still represents the same relationship between the variables.

# TIP

$\Rightarrow$  is a symbol that can be used to mean 'implies that'.

# Exercise 6.3

Make the variable shown in brackets the subject of the formula in each case.

1 a a + b = c (a) b p - q = r (r) c fh = g (h)  
d  $ab + c = d$  (b) e  $\frac{a}{b} = c$  (a) f an-m=t (n)  
2 a an-m=t (m) b a(n-m)=t (a) c  $\frac{xy}{z} = t$  (x)  
d  $\frac{x - a}{b} = c$  (x) e  $x(c - y) = d$  (y) f  $a - b = c$  (b)  
3 a  $p - \frac{r}{q} = t$  (r) b  $\frac{x - a}{b} = c$  (b) c  $a(n - m) = t$  (m)  
d  $\frac{a}{b} = \frac{c}{d}$  (a) e  $\frac{x - a}{b} = c$  (a) f  $\frac{xy}{z} = t$  (z)  
4 a  $\sqrt{b} = c$  (b) b  $\sqrt{ab} = c$  (b) c a  $\sqrt{b} = c$  (b)  
d  $\sqrt{b + c} = c$  (b) e  $\sqrt{x - b} = c$  (b) f  $\frac{x}{\sqrt{y}} = c$  (y)

# APPLY YOUR SKILLS

5 The perimeter of a rectangle can be given as  $P = 2(1 + w)$ , where  $l$  is the length and  $w$  is the width of the rectangle.

a Make w the subject of the formula.  
b Find w if a rectangle has a length of  $45\mathrm{cm}$  and a perimeter of  $161\mathrm{cm}$

6 A small plane is about to take off from an aircraft carrier. The plane is pushed forwards using a steam device, so that it accelerates at a rate controlled by the ship's crew.

The pilot knows that if  $u =$  initial speed, and  $v =$  speed at time  $t$  seconds, then:

$$
v = u + a t
$$

where  $a$  is the acceleration and  $t$  is the time that has passed.

a Rearrange the formula to make t the subject so the pilot can easily calculate the time for any given values of u, v and a.  
b Calculate the initial speed of the plane if the speed at 2 seconds is  $78\mathrm{m / s}$  and the plane is accelerating at a rate of  $33.64\mathrm{m / s^2}$

7 If the length of a pendulum is  $l$  metres, the acceleration due to gravity is  $gms^{-2}$  and  $T$  is the period of the oscillation in seconds then:

$$
T = 2 \pi \sqrt {\frac {I}{9}}
$$

Rearrange the formula to make  $l$  the subject.

# SELF ASSESSMENT

List three things that you did well.   
What could you improve?   
What skills did you use here that you learned earlier or in other sections of work?

# Chapter 7

# Perimeter, area and volume

# IN THIS CHAPTER YOU WILL:

calculate areas and perimeters of two-dimensional shapes  
calculate areas and perimeters of shapes that can be separated into two or more simpler shapes  
calculate areas and circumferences of circles  
calculate areas and perimeters of circular sectors  
use nets for three-dimensional solids  
calculate volumes and surface areas of solids  
calculate volumes and surface area of pyramids, cones and spheres.

The glass pyramid at the entrance to the Louvre Art Gallery in Paris reaches to a height of  $20.6\mathrm{m}$ . It is a beautiful example of a three-dimensional object. A smaller pyramid – suspended upside down – acts as a skylight in an underground mall in front of the museum.

Where have you seen pyramids or any other three-dimension objects used in architecture? Why do we need to know how to work out volumes and surface areas of these objects?

# GETTING STARTED

Imagine you have six 1 cm by 1 cm square tiles. What fraction of each of the following shapes could you cover with the tiles without cutting or folding any of them and without the edges of any tile falling outside the shape? Simplify your answers as far as possible.

# olygons

A polygon is a flat (two-dimensional) shape with three or more straight sides. The perimeter of a polygon is the sum of the lengths of its sides. The perimeter measures the total distance around the outside of the polygon.

# MATHEMATICAL CONNECTIONS

'Two-dimensional' means that you need two different pieces of information to find any given point on the shape. Usually you will use  $x$ - and  $y$ -coordinates for two dimensions, but you can also use a bearing and a distance, for example. You will learn about bearings in Chapter 15.

The area of a polygon measures how much space is contained inside it.

# Units of area

If the dimensions of your shape are given in cm, then the units of area are square centimetres and this is written cm². For metres, m² is used and for kilometres, km² is used and so on. Area is always given in square units.

# TIP

If an area is given in  $\mathrm{cm}^2$ , this tells you the number of  $1\mathrm{cm} \times 1\mathrm{cm}$  squares you need to cover exactly the same area.

# TIP

You will also see  $A = I \times w$  for the area of a rectangle. The two formulae are equivalent, here the base,  $b$ , is equivalent to the length,  $l$ , and the height,  $h$ , is equivalent to the width,  $w$ .

# WORKED EXAMPLE 1

a Calculate the area of the shape shown in the diagram.

![](images/91fdbc9fe8a8b231b0f735fbf9d77dcd1916710882219f35bf6667a2ffb10bd1.jpg)

# Answer

Divide the shape into two simple polygons: a rectangle and a triangle. Work out the area of each shape and then add them together.

![](images/14fdf9d96f723938870226588042c59f8cf84256bcad5fb853f737523415d800.jpg)

Area of rectangle  $= bh = 7\times 5 = 35cm^2$  (substitute values in place of  $b$  and  $h$

Area of triangle  $= \frac{1}{2} bh = \frac{1}{2} \times 5 \times 6 = \frac{1}{2} \times 30 = 15\mathrm{cm}^2$

Total area  $= 35 + 15 = 50\mathrm{cm}^2$

b The area of a triangle is  $40\mathrm{cm}^2$  . If the base of the triangle is  $5\mathrm{cm}$  , find the height.

# Answer

$$
A = \frac {1}{2} \times b \times h
$$

Use the formula for the area of a triangle.

$$
4 0 = \frac {1}{2} \times 5 \times h
$$

Substitute all values that you know.

$$
\Rightarrow 4 0 \times 2 = 5 \times h
$$

$\Rightarrow  h = \frac{{40} \times  2}{5} = \frac{80}{5} = {16}\mathrm{\;{cm}}$

Rearrange the formula to make  $h$  the subject.

c A square has area  $36\mathrm{cm}^2$  . Find the perimeter of the square.

# Answer

If  $x$  is the length of each side of the square, then:

$$
\begin{array}{l} x ^ {2} = 3 6 \\ x = \sqrt {3 6} = 6 \mathrm {c m} \\ \end{array}
$$

There are four equal sides, so the perimeter is  $4 \times 6 = 24\mathrm{cm}$ .

# TIP

You do not usually have to redraw the separate shapes, but you might find it helpful.

# TIP

You can write the formula for the area of a triangle in different ways:

$$
\begin{array}{l} \frac {1}{2} \times b \times h = \frac {b h}{2} \\ \text {O R} = \left(\frac {1}{2} b\right) \times h \\ \text {O R} = b \times \left(\frac {1}{2} h\right) \\ \end{array}
$$

Make sure that you include the formula you use in your working.

# TIP

You learnt how to rearrange and solve linear equations in Chapter 6.

# TIP

It can be confusing to include units in all your working, but, where it is possible, always give units in your final answer.

# Exercise 7.1

1 By measuring the lengths of each side and adding them together, find the perimeter of each of the following shapes.

4 A triangular plate of glass forms part of a large stained-glass window.

a If the base of the plate is  $45\mathrm{cm}$  and the height is  $2.6\mathrm{m}$  calculate the area of the glass plate, giving your answer in:

i cm²

m²

b Another triangular section of the window has area  $0.54\mathrm{m}^2$  and base  $30\mathrm{cm}$  Find the height of the section in cm.

5 The following shapes can all be divided into simpler shapes. In each case find the total area.

# Finding the circumference of a circle

Circumference is the word used to identify the perimeter of a circle. Note that the diameter  $= 2 \times$  radius  $= 2r$ . The Ancient Greeks knew that they could find the circumference of a circle by multiplying the diameter by a particular number. This number is now known as  $\pi$ , which is the Greek letter 'pi'.  $\pi$  is equal to 3.141592654... This is only the start of the number;  $\pi$  is an irrational number, so the decimal places go on forever and never repeat.

You can find the circumference of a circle using formulae that uses either the radius or the diameter:

Circumference  $= \pi \times$  diameter  
$= \pi d$  (where  $d =$  diameter)  
$= 2\pi r$  (where  $r =$  radius)

# Finding the area of a circle

There is a simple formula for calculating the area of a circle. Here is a method that shows how you can work out the formula:

Consider the circle shown in the diagram. It has been divided into 12 equal parts and these have been rearranged to give the diagram on the right.

![](images/fbd23a338a42edc6354df4e785f36b7ab4d76f9bf7c6ecbc19c75a4b0c410c73.jpg)

The parts of the circle are narrow, so the shape almost forms a rectangle with height equal to the radius of the circle and the length equal to half of the circumference.

The formula for the area of a rectangle is area  $= bh$ , so:

Area of a circle is approximately equal to

$\frac{1}{2} \times 2\pi r \times r$  (Using the base and height shown in the diagram on the previous page.)

$$
= \pi r ^ {2} \quad \text {(S i m p l i f y .)}
$$

If you try this yourself by dividing a circle into a greater number of parts that are even narrower, you will notice that the right-hand diagram will look even more like a rectangle.

This indicates (but does not prove) that the area of a circle is given by:  $A = \pi r^2$ .

You will now look at some examples so that you can see how to apply these formulae.

# MATHEMATICAL CONNECTIONS

BODMAS in Chapter 1 tells you to calculate the square of the radius before multiplying by  $\pi$ .

# Exact answers as multiples of  $\pi$

Pi is an irrational number so you cannot write out its exact value as a decimal. You can approximate it using a rounded decimal, or by using fractions that are similar in value, but none of these methods give the exact answer.

If you are asked to give an exact answer in any calculation that uses pi it means you have to give the answer in terms of pi. In other words, your answer will be a multiple of pi and the  $\pi$  symbol should be in the answer.

If the circumference or area of a circle is given in terms of  $\pi$ , you can work out the length of the diameter or radius by dividing by pi.

For example, if  $C = 5\pi$  cm the diameter is 5cm and the radius is 2.5cm (half the diameter).

Similarly, if  $A = 25\pi \mathrm{cm}^2$  then  $r^2 = 25$  and  $r = \sqrt{25} = 5\mathrm{cm}$ .

# Arcs and sectors

The diagram shows a circle with two radii (plural of radius) drawn from the centre.

The region contained in-between the two radii is known as a sector. Notice that there is a major sector and a minor sector.

A section of the circumference is known as an arc.

The Greek letter  $\theta$  represents the angle subtended at the centre. Notice that the minor sector is a fraction of the full circle. It is  $\frac{\theta}{360}$  of the circle.

The area of a circle is  $\pi r^2$ . The sector is  $\frac{\theta}{360}$  of the circle, so we can replace 'of' with '×' to give:

Sector area = θ/360 × πr²

![](images/d56a2ca3e72b0cfd8f344c6a8556da57a6ac4871a920650b20df33b253da2054.jpg)

The circumference of a circle is  $2\pi r$ . The sector is  $\frac{\theta}{360}$  of the circle, so the length of the arc of the sector is  $\frac{\theta}{360}$  of the circumference. So:

Arc length = 360 × 2πr

Make sure that you remember these two special cases:

If  $\theta = 90^{\circ}$  then you have a quarter of a circle.  
If  $\theta = 180^{\circ}$  then you have a half of a circle. This is known as a semicircle.

Answer

Total area = area of triangle + area of a semicircle

$$
A r e a = \frac {1}{2} b h + \frac {1}{2} \pi r ^ {2} = \frac {1}{2} \times 8 \times 6 + \frac {1}{2} \pi \times 4 ^ {2} = 4 9. 1 3 2 \dots
$$

is approximately equal to  $49.1\mathrm{cm}^2$  (3 s.f.)

$$
\text {P e r i m e t e r} = \sqrt {5 2} + \sqrt {5 2} + \frac {1}{2} \times 2 \pi \times 4 = 2 7. 0 \mathrm {c m} (3 \mathrm {s}. \mathrm {f}.)
$$

# TIP

Note that for the perimeter you need to add 5m twice because you need to include the two straight edges.

# 7.2 Three-dimensional objects

The focus of the rest of this chapter is three-dimensional objects, but you will use many of the formulae for two-dimensional shapes in your calculations. A three-dimensional object is called a solid.

# Nets of solids

A net is a two-dimensional shape that can be drawn, cut out and folded to form a three-dimensional solid.

This is the net of a solid that you should be quite familiar with.

![](images/aa4707006e0041e903b6bb69daf723ad9df54e5ca9e0c77e0d2fae45392ba463.jpg)

If you fold along the dotted lines and join the points with the same letters then you will form this cube.

You should try this yourself and look carefully at which edges (sides) and which vertices (points or corners) join up.

# TIP

Cardboard boxes start out as a flat shape. The cardboard is then folded along carefully chosen lines, which become the edges of the box. Try unfolding a box to see how it was made.

a Find the surface area of the cuboid in  $\mathrm{cm}^2$  
b Find the volume of the cuboid in  $\mathfrak{m}^3$

# 7.3 Surface areas and volumes of solids

The flat, two-dimensional surfaces on the outside of a solid are called faces. You can find the area of each face using the techniques from earlier in this chapter. The total area of all the faces is the surface area of the solid.

The volume is the amount of space contained inside the solid. If the lengths are given in centimetres, then the volume is measured in cubic centimetres  $(\mathrm{cm}^3)$  and so on.

# TIP

We measure the amount of water flowing over a waterfall in cubic metres per second. The maximum flow of water over the Iguazu Falls in South America was 45700 cubic metres per second, on 9 June 2014. This is the equivalent to more than 18 standard Olympic swimming pools being emptied over the waterfall every second!

# TIP

It can be helpful to draw the net of a solid when trying to find its surface area.

# Cuboids

A cuboid has six rectangular faces, twelve edges and eight vertices.

If the length, width and height of the cuboid are  $a, b$  and  $c$  (respectively) then you can find the surface area by thinking about the areas of each rectangular face.

![](images/ea12414232378b3621b3d28d34b02267f3a9c73587beb82f509b24345e9305b5.jpg)

Notice that the surface area is exactly the same as the area of the cuboid's net.

Surface area of cuboid  $= 2(ab + ac + bc)$

![](images/51499341af2d2ec0753fcd9546b3b4df01b20b07f079a1393d8ed08ae708f53b.jpg)

The volume of a cuboid is its length  $\times$  width  $\times$  height.

Volume of cuboid  $= a b c$

![](images/4813f77236ed1fbb7cec30d956f6039b18aeb5227ed1128ff165f1f2c5b87330.jpg)

# Prisms

A prism is a solid whose cross-section is the same all along its length. (A cross-section is the surface formed when you cut parallel to a face.)

![](images/5bf2858eb1c6f6c7eddbcdf6b276fb26de980b41d3430f2090f3fde0bcbe5af8.jpg)

Prisms are often named according to the shape of their cross-section. For example, a triangular prism has a triangle cross-section, a pentagonal prism has a pentagon cross-section and so on.

A cuboid is a prism with a rectangular cross-section, so you may sometimes see it called a rectangular prism.

![](images/e057dce9c0908eea48f16acf38b4aac2449f25e9579eedcbc5661591223b6789.jpg)

![](images/527482ce4cb0554297550bb783cd6df25302cbe48152f2c87b2de797e36a56ff.jpg)

You can calculate the surface area of a prism by working out the area of each face and adding them together. There are two ends with area equal to the cross-sectional area. The remaining sides are all the same length, so their area is equal to the perimeter of the cross-section multiplied by the length:

Surface area of a prism  $= 2 \times$  area of cross-section + perimeter of cross-section  $\times$  length

You can calculate the volume of a prism by working out the area of the cross-section and multiplying this by the length.

Volume of a prism  $=$  area of cross-section  $\times$  length

# Cylinders

A cylinder is not a prism, because the cross section has curved edges. The cross section of a cylinder is a circle and is the same all along its length, so a cylinder is a 'tube'.

![](images/7f358ad5b6908d87f3db293f0e70077ebdf482e51b757624e97a2242d6672e28.jpg)

A cylinder can be 'unwrapped' to produce its net. The surface of the solid consists of two circular faces and a curved surface that can be flattened to make a rectangle.

Curved surface area of a cylinder  $= 2\pi rh$

and

Volume of a cylinder  $= \pi r^2 h$

![](images/c7e95d1a86f51f890b1b3f6954e6ce04fb909c0d49cd81771c0d7e3684722342.jpg)

# LINK

Deep sea divers carry tanks filled with compressed air on their backs. These tanks are usually shaped like cylinders, making it easy to calculate the volume and to work out how much air is left.

# TIP

If questions ask for exact answers to surface area and volume calculations where  $\pi$  is part of the formula, you must give your answer as a multiple of  $\pi$ .

# Exercise 7.6

1 Find the volume and surface area of the solid with the net shown in the diagram.

# Pyramids

A pyramid is a solid with a polygon-shaped base and triangular faces that meet at a point called the apex.

You can find the surface area of a pyramid by finding the area of the base and the area of each of the triangles and adding them all together.

You can find the volume of a pyramid by using the following formula:

Volume  $= \frac{1}{3} \times$  base area  $\times$  perpendicular height

The perpendicular height is the shortest distance from the base to the apex.

# Cones

A cone is a not a pyramid, because it has a circular base and a curved surface. The length  $l$  is known as the slant height and  $h$  is the perpendicular height.

# MATHEMATICAL CONNECTIONS

The slant height can be calculated using Pythagoras' theorem, which you will meet in Chapter 11.

The curved surface of the cone can be opened out and flattened to form a sector of a circle.

Curved surface area of cone  $= \pi r l$

If you are asked for the total surface area of a cone, you must work out the area of the circular base and add it to the curved surface area.

# TIP

Remember, if you are asked for an exact answer you must give the answer as a multiple of  $\pi$  and you cannot use approximate values in the calculation.

# REFLECTION

# TIP

Look back to

Chapter 1 if you need some suggestions for sentence stems to get started.

# SUMMARY

# Do you know ...?

The perimeter is the distance around the outside of a two-dimensional shape and the area is the space contained within the sides.

Circumference is the name for the perimeter of a circle.

If the units of length are given in cm then the units of area are cm² and the units of volume are cm³.

This relationship is also true if the lengths are measured in mm, m, km and so on.

A sector of a circle is the region contained in-between two radii of a circle. This splits the circle into a minor sector and a major sector.

An arc is a section of the circumference.

Prisms, pyramids, spheres, cubes and cuboids are examples of three-dimensional objects (or solids).

A net is a two-dimensional shape that can be folded to form a solid.

The net of a solid can be useful when working out the surface area of the solid.

# Are you able to ...?

To recognise different two-dimensional shapes and find their areas,

give the units of the area

calculate the areas of various two-dimensional shapes

divide a shape into simpler shapes and find the area.

find unknown lengths when some lengths and an area are given.

calculate the area and circumference of a circle.

# Chapter 8

# Introduction to probability

# IN THIS CHAPTER YOU WILL:

express probabilities mathematically  
calculate probabilities associated with simple experiments  
- use sample space diagrams to help you calculate the probability of combined events  
- identify when events are independent  
- identify when events are mutually exclusive.

Your genes are made up of DNA that determines the characteristics you are born with. The probability of two unrelated people having a matching DNA profile is very rare, approximately  $\frac{1}{1000000000}$  or  $0.0000001\%$ . Scientists can use the genetic profiles of parents to determine the probability of their children inheriting certain characteristics or conditions. For example, if a child's parents both carry the gene for a condition like cystic fibrosis or sickle cell anaemia, the probability that the child will be born with the condition is  $\frac{1}{4}$  or  $25\%$ . Does this mean that a couple who have four children will have three children without the condition and one with it? Why?

# GETTING STARTED

Most modern calculators are able to produce random numbers. Usually, there will be a number with the word 'ran' or 'ran#" written on it. For most, if you press this button and then press the = button, it will give you a random decimal between 0 and 1.

1 Try to work out how to use the random number button on your calculator.  
2 Play a game of 'higher or lower' with yourself.

- Start by getting a random number from your calculator.  
- Guess whether the next number will be 'higher' or 'lower'.  
Find another random number and work out whether it was 'higher' or 'lower' than the previous number.  
Were you correct?  
If yes, take another go; if no, stop.  
Write down the number of turns you take without getting it wrong.

3 Think about how you can maximise your chances of being correct. For which numbers would you most sensibly choose 'higher'? What about lower?

# 8.1 Understanding basic probability

Think about rolling dice. You cannot accurately predict what number you will roll, but you do know what the possible outcomes are. The set of all possible outcomes (1, 2, 3, 4, 5 or 5) is called the sample space. Any subset of the sample space is called an event. For example, rolling 2, 4 or 6 is an event. This can be described in words as getting an even number. We say that the event 'getting an even number' occurs if the outcome of rolling the dice is a 2, 4 or 6.

Probability is a measure of how likely an event is to happen. Something that is impossible has a value of zero and something that is certain has a value of one. The range of values from zero to one is called a probability scale. A probability cannot be negative, nor can it be greater than one.

The closer a probability is to zero, the less likely the event is to happen. The closer the probability is to one, the more likely the event is to happen.

theoretical probability

trial

Performing an experiment, such as rolling a dice, is called a trial. If you repeat an experiment, by carrying out a number of trials, you can find the experimental probability of an event happening. This fraction is often called the relative frequency

$$
P (A) = \frac {\text {n u m b e r o f t i m e s d e s i r e d e v e n t h a p p e n s}}{\text {n u m b e r o f t r i a l s}}
$$

or, sometimes:

$$
P (A) = \frac {\text {n u m b e r o f s u c c e s s e s}}{\text {n u m b e r o f t r i a l s}}
$$

# TIP

$P(A)$  means the probability of event A happening.

# WORKED EXAMPLE 1

A person is blindfolded and asked to throw darts at a dartboard.

If they hit the dartboard 15 times out of 125 throws, estimate the probability they hit the dartboard on their next throw.

# Answer

$$
\begin{array}{l} P (\text {s i x}) = \frac {\text {n u m b e r t i m e s t h e p e r o n h i t s d a r t b o r d}}{\text {n u m b e r o f t r i a l s}} \\ = \frac {1 5}{1 2 5} \\ = 0. 1 2 \\ \end{array}
$$

# TIP

You can use fractions, decimals or percentages in probability, but fractions are often best (especially if the decimal is recurring). You should write fractions in their simplest form.

# Relative frequency and expected occurrences

You can use relative frequency work out how many times you expect something to occur over a large number of trials. For example, if you know that the relative frequency of rolling a four on particular dice is  $18\%$ , you can work out how many times you would expect to get a four when you roll the dice 80 or 200 times.

# MATHEMATICAL CONNECTIONS

Remember that a percentage is a fraction with denominator of 100. If a probability is  $18\%$ , then it is  $\frac{18}{100} = \frac{9}{50}$  when written as a fraction.

# TIP

Experimental probability is an estimate of how likely something is. The more data you collect in your experiment, the more accurate your probability estimate will be.

18% of  $80 = 14.4$  and  $18\%$  of  $200 = 36$ , so if you rolled the same dice 80 times you would expect to get a four about 14 times and if you rolled it 200 times, you would expect to get a four 36 times.

Remember though, that even if you expected to get a four 36 times, this is not guaranteed and your actual results may be very different.

# Theoretical probability

When you flip a coin you may be interested in the event 'getting a head' but this is only one possibility. When you flip a coin there are two possible outcomes: 'getting a head' or 'getting a tail.'

If all the possible outcomes are equally likely, you can calculate the theoretical probability of an event by counting the number of favourable outcomes and dividing by the number of possible outcomes. Favourable outcomes are any outcomes that mean your event has happened.

Using the example from the start of the chapter, if you roll an unbiased dice and want to find the probability of getting an even number, then the favourable outcomes are two, four or six. There are six possible outcomes and three of them are favourable.

If  $A$  is the event 'you get an even number', then:

$$
P (A) = \frac {\text {n u m b e r o f f a v o u r a b l e o u t c o m e s}}{\text {n u m b e r o f p o s s i b l e o u t c o m e s}} = \frac {3}{6} = \frac {1}{2}
$$

![](images/79dc8beb6d1e56e957399111af1059054870de1f35c6d708cf72a1764e064502.jpg)

Outcomes are equally likely because there is something about the experiment that makes them so. In the example of the dice, all of the faces on a fair dice are the same size and shape.

Of course, a dice may be weighted in some way, or imperfectly made, and this can be true of any object discussed in a probability question. Under these circumstances a dice, coin or other object is said to be biased. The outcomes will no longer be equally likely and you may need to use experimental probability.

# WORKED EXAMPLE 2

The numbers one to six are written on six identical cards. The cards are shuffled and placed face down on a table. If a card is selected at random, what is the probability of obtaining:

a a three

b an even number

a prime number?

# Answers

a P(3) = 1/6

There is only one way of picking a three, but six possible outcomes (you could select a 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6).

b P(even number) = 3/6 = 1/2

There are three ways of picking an even number, giving three favourable outcomes.

c  $P(\text{prime number}) = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2}$

The prime numbers you could pick are 2, 3 and 5, giving three favourable outcomes.

# TIP

In some countries, theoretical probability is referred to as 'expected probability'. This is a casual reference and does not mean the same thing as mathematical 'expectation'.

# TIP

Questions will usually tell you whether an object or experiment is unbiased.

# WORKED EXAMPLE 3

A card is drawn from an ordinary park of 52 cards. What is the probability that the card will be a king?

# Answer

$$
P (\text {k i n g}) = \frac {4}{5 2} = \frac {1}{1 3}
$$

Number of possible outcomes is 52.

Number of favourable outcomes is four, because there are four kings per pack.

# TIP

A set of 52 playing cards four suits: hearts, diamonds, clubs and spades. Hearts and diamonds are red. Clubs and spades are black. Each suit is made up of numbers 2 to 10 and an ace, jack, queen and king.

# WORKED EXAMPLE 4

Nasir has 20 socks in a drawer.

Eight socks are red, ten socks are blue and two socks are green. If a sock is drawn at random, what is the probability that it is green?

# Answer

P(green) = 2/20 = 1/10

Number of possible outcomes is 20.

Number of favourable outcomes is two.

# WORKED EXAMPLE 5

Nine teams of painters were each given one letter from the word HOLLYWOOD to paint. Each painting team was given a letter at random. Find the probability that a team of painters was asked to paint:

a the letter Y

b the letter 'O'

c the letter 'H' or the letter 'L'

d the letter 'Z'.

# Answers

a  $P(Y) = \frac{1}{9}$

Number of favourable outcomes is one (there is only one 'Y').

There are nine possible outcomes in total.

b  $P(O) = \frac{3}{9} = \frac{1}{3}$

Number of favourable outcomes is three.

c  $P(H$  or  $L) = \frac{3}{9} = \frac{1}{3}$

Number of favourable outcomes  $=$  number of letters that are either  $\mathsf{H}^{\prime}$  or  $\mathsf{L}^{\prime} = 3$  since there is one  $\mathsf{H}^{\prime}$  and two L's.

d  $P(Z) = \frac{0}{9} = 0$

Number of favourable outcomes is zero (there are no 'Z's).

# The probability that an event does not happen

Something may happen or it may not happen. The probability that an event happens will usually be different from the probability that the event does not happen, but the two combined probabilities will always add up to one.

If  $A$  is an event, then  $A'$  is the event that  $A$  does not happen and  $P(A') = 1 - P(A)$ .

# TIP

When you talk about  $A^\prime$  you usually refer to it as not  $A^{\prime}$  Sometimes you may see A used instead of  $A^{\prime}$

# WORKED EXAMPLE 6

The probability that Jas passes a driving test is  $\frac{2}{3}$ . What is the probability that Jas fails the driving test?

# Answer

$$
P (\text {f a i l s}) = 1 - \frac {2}{3} = \frac {1}{3} \quad P (\text {f a i l s}) = P (\text {n o t p a s s i n g}) = 1 - P (\text {p a s s i n g})
$$

# TIP

When the probability of an event happens is equal to the probability the event does not happen, both probabilities must be equal to  $\frac{1}{2}$ . This probability is sometimes referred to as 'evens'.

# INVESTIGATION

# Talking about probability

Many people try to use probability terms, but don't fully understand the statement they are making. How would you explain what is wrong with each of the following statements?

1 In a 'true or false' quiz with ten questions, you are certain to get five right if you guess.  
2 In a rowing race a team can win, lose or draw, so the probability they win is  $\frac{1}{3}$ .  
3 If you roll a dice ten times and get four sixes, the dice must be biased.  
4 There are 16 red socks and 24 blue socks in a drawer. If you pull ten socks out of the drawer there will always be more blue socks than red socks.  
5 The sign by the ice cream stall says that the probability of rain today is  $\frac{1}{5}$ , but it is raining, so the probability it rains today must have always been 1.

# Exercise 8.1

1 A six-sided dice is thrown 100 times and the number five appears 14 times.

a Find the experimental probability of throwing a five, giving your answer as a fraction in its lowest terms.  
b Write your answer to part (a) as a percentage.

# TIP

Probabilities are most often given as decimals or fractions, but you can also use percentages. For example, you can write a probability of  $\frac{1}{2}$  as  $50\%$  or a probability of 0.32 as  $32\%$ .

# 8.2 Sample space diagrams

The probability space, or sample space, is the set of all possible outcomes. You can draw a sample space diagram to show all outcomes clearly and use it to work out the probability of different events.

# TIP

In some countries, these might be called 'probability space diagrams'.

The diagram shows that there are 36 possible sums, so there are 36 equally likely outcomes in total.

a P(7) = 6 1 36 6

There are six 7s in the grid, so six favourable outcomes.

b  $P(\text{less than} 5) = \frac{6}{36} = \frac{1}{6}$

The outcomes that are less than 5 are 2, 3 and 4. There are six favourable outcomes for these numbers.

c  $P(\text{greater than or equal to 8}) = \frac{15}{36}$

The outcomes greater than or equal to 8 (which includes 8) are 8, 9, 10, 11 or 12.

$$
= \frac {5}{1 2}
$$

These give 15 favourable outcomes.

d  $P(\text{less than } 8) = 1 - \frac{5}{12} = \frac{7}{12}$

P(less than 8) = P(not greater than or equal to 8)

$= 1 - P$  (greater than or equal to 8)

# PEER ASSESSMENT

1 Work with a partner. Look at the sample space diagrams your partner has drawn in Exercise 8.2.  
2 Use the following criteria to assess each other's sample space diagrams. Highlight any problematic areas and provide corrections or suggestions for improving the diagram.

# Criteria:

All possible outcomes are correctly indicated.  
The diagram is easy to read and interpret.  
You can find the probability of different events easily.

# REFLECTION

Sometimes giving students marks and asking them to do corrections does not help them to improve their mathematical understanding. It can be more useful for the person marking the work to write one or two questions such as:

Have you checked that all the possible outcomes are shown?  
Did you draw a clear diagram?

How do you think someone asking questions could help you to overcome difficulties and understand the work better?

# 8.3 Combining independent and mutually exclusive events

Sometimes you will need to calculate the probability that two events happen, one after the other. You might also need to calculate the probability that either of two events happen. In this section you will learn some rules for calculating the probability of combined events

# Independent events

If you flip an unbiased coin once, the probability of it showing a head is 0.5. Whatever happened the first time, if you flip the coin a second time the probability of it showing a head will still be 0.5. The result of the first throw has no influence on the result of the second throw. Situations like this are called independent events

Imagine you have a bag containing different coloured balls. If you choose a ball, note its colour, replace it and then choose another, the choice of the first ball does not influence the choice of the second ball. These events are also independent.

If you do not replace the first ball the events will not be independent. There is one ball less for the second choice so the probabilities will have changed. You will think about situations like this in Chapter 24.

You can calculate the probability that two independent events,  $A$  and  $B$ , both occur:

$P(A$  happens and then  $B$  happens)  $= P(A)\times P(B)$

or

$P(A$  and  $B) = P(A)\times P(B)$

For example, when flipping two coins,

P(flipping two heads) = P(Heads) × P(Heads) = 1/2 × 1/2 = 1/4

# TIP

Note that this formula is only true if  $A$  and  $B$  are independent.

# Mutually exclusive events

If you throw a normal dice and let:

$$
A = \text {t h e e v e n t t h a t y o u g e a n e v e n n u m b e r}
$$

and

$$
B = \text {t h e e v e n t t h a t y o u g e a n o d d n u m b e r}
$$

then  $A$  and  $B$  cannot happen together because no number is both even and odd at the same time. You can say that  $A$  and  $B$  are mutually exclusive events.

# MATHEMATICAL CONNECTIONS

When you throw a dice, the events 'get an even number' and 'get a number less than four' are not mutually exclusive because if you throw a two, both events occur at the same time. You will learn more about these sorts of events in Chapter 24.

For two mutually exclusive events  $A$  and  $B$ , you can calculate the probability that either  $A$  or  $B$  occurs:

$$
P (A \text {o r} B) = P (A) + P (B)
$$

For example, when rolling a normal dice,

For example, when the number of odd numbers is  $P(\text{even number or odd number}) = P(\text{even number}) + P(\text{odd number}) = \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{2} = 1$

Worked examples 8 and 9 demonstrate how you can use these simple formulae for independent and mutually exclusive events.

# TIP

Note, this formula only works if A and B are mutually exclusive.

# WORKED EXAMPLE 8

Noa and Sunja are both taking a music examination independently.

The probability that Noa passes is  $\frac{3}{4}$  and the probability that Sunja passes is  $\frac{5}{6}$ .

What is the probability that:

a both pass?

b neither passes?

at least one passes?

either Noa or Sunja passes (but not both)?

# Answers

a  $P(\text{both pass}) = P(\text{Noa passes and Sunja passes})$

The outcomes are independent so use the formula:

$$
= \frac {3}{4} \times \frac {5}{6} = \frac {1 5}{2 4} = \frac {5}{8}
$$

$$
P (A \text {a n d} B) = P (A) \times P (B)
$$

b  $P$  (neither passes)  $= P$  (Noa fails and Sunja fails

$$
\begin{array}{l} P (\text {f a i l}) = P (\text {n o t p a s s}) \\ = \left(1 - \frac {3}{4}\right) \times \left(1 - \frac {5}{6}\right) \\ = 1 - P (\text {p a s s}) \\ = \frac {1}{4} \times \frac {1}{6} \\ = \frac {1}{2 4} \\ \end{array}
$$

# WORKED EXAMPLE 8 CONTINUED

c  $P$  (at least one passes)  $= 1 - P$  (neither passes)

$$
= 1 - \frac {1}{2 4} = \frac {2 3}{2 4}
$$

d P(either Sunja or Noa passes)

$= P(\text{Noa passes and Sunja fails})$

or Noa fails and Sunja passes)

$$
\begin{array}{l} = \frac {3}{4} \times \frac {1}{6} + \frac {1}{4} \times \frac {5}{6} \\ = \frac {3}{2 4} + \frac {5}{2 4} \\ = \frac {8}{2 4} \\ = \frac {1}{3} \\ \end{array}
$$

'Noa passes and Sunja fails' and, 'Noa fails and Sunja passes,' are mutually exclusive because they cannot both happen at the same time. So use the formula:

$P(A$  or  $B) = P(A) + P(B)$  , where

A = Noa passes and Sunja fails

and

$B =$  Noa fails and Sunja passes.

# TIP

It is not possible to pass and fail an exam at the same time. This is why the events are mutually exclusive.

# WORKED EXAMPLE 9

Simone and Rami are playing basketball. The probability that Simone shoots the ball into the net is 0.1. The probability that Rami shoots the ball into the net is 0.2. Simone's success or failure at shooting the ball into the net is independent of Rami's and vice versa.

Simone and Rami take one shot each. Find the probability that:

a both shoot the ball into the net  
b Simone shoots the ball into the net, but Rami does not  
c exactly one ball is shot into the net.

# Answers

a  $P$  (both shoot the ball into the net)  $= 0.1\times 0.2 = 0.02$  
b  $P$  (Simone shoots the ball into the net but Rami does not)  $= 0.1 \times (1 - 0.2) = 0.1 \times 0.8 = 0.08$  
c  $P$  (exactly one ball is shot into the net)  $= P$  (Simone shoots the ball into the net and Rami does not or Simone does not shoot the ball into the net and Rami does)

$$
\begin{array}{l} = 0. 1 \times 0. 8 + 0. 9 \times 0. 2 \\ = 0. 0 8 + 0. 1 8 \\ = 0. 2 6 \\ \end{array}

# SUMMARY

# Do you know ...?

Probability measures how likely something is to happen.

An outcome is the single result of an experiment.

An event is a collection of favourable outcomes.

Experimental probability can be calculated by dividing the number of favourable outcomes by the number of trials.

Favourable outcomes are any outcomes that mean your event has happened.

If outcomes are equally likely then theoretical probability can be calculated by dividing the number of favourable outcomes by the number of possible outcomes.

The probability of an event happening and the probability of that event not happening will always sum up to one. If  $A$  is an event, then  $A'$  is the event that  $A$  does not happen and  $P(A) = 1 - P(A)$ .

Independent events do not affect one another.

Mutually exclusive events cannot happen together.

# 9.1 Sequences

A sequence is set of numbers (or a pattern) that follow a particular order. Each number in a sequence is called a term. Terms that follow each other in a sequence are called consecutive terms.

The position of a term is given using  $\mathbf{T}$  so  $\mathbf{T}_1$  is the first term,  $\mathbf{T}_5$  is the fifth term and  $\mathbf{T}_n$  is any term.

The terms in a sequence usually follow a rule. You can use the rule for a sequence to work out which term comes next or the value of any term in the sequence.

There are different kinds of sequences.

Arithmetic sequences have a common (constant) difference between the terms. For example, the sequence 2, 6, 10, 14, ... has a common difference of +4 and the sequence 100, 92, 84, 76, ... has a common difference of -8. Arithmetic sequences are linear sequences.

Non-linear sequences do not have a common difference between the terms.

Geometric sequences involve multiplying or dividing by a common ratio. For example, each term in the sequence 3, 6, 12, 24, ... is found by multiplying the previous term by 2 and the sequence 800, 400, 200, 100, ... is formed by dividing the previous term by 2.

Some sequences involve powers:

quadratic sequences involve square numbers. For example, 1, 4, 9, 16, ...  
cubic sequences involve cube numbers. For example, 1, 8, 27, 64, ...

# The term-to-term rule

Here are some sequences with the rule that tells you how to keep the sequence going:

2, 8, 14, 20, 26, 32, ... (get the next term by adding six to the previous term).

You can show this pattern by drawing it in this way:

1,  $\frac{1}{2}, \frac{1}{4}, \frac{1}{8}, \frac{1}{16}, \ldots$  (divide each term by two to get the next term).

This diagram shows how the sequence progresses:

1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, ... (multiply each term by two to get the next term).

Sequences of numbers are often used in cryptography, the science of codebreaking. In a simple code, the letters of the alphabet (which already form a clear sequence) can be matched to letters or numbers in another sequence. If you know the patterns defining the sequence, you can crack the codes.

# LINK

Chemists often need to understand how quantities change over time. An understanding of sequences can help chemists to understand how a reaction works and this allows them to predict what their results will be.

The rule that tells you how to generate the next term in a sequence is called the term-to-term rule. These rules are usually given in words and they tell you which operation to use to work out the next term.

# Exercise 9.1

1 Draw a diagram to show how each of the following sequences continues and find the next three terms in each case.

a 5,7,9,11,13,...

b 3,8,13,18,23,...

d 0.5,2,3.5,5,6.5,..

e 8,5,2,-1,-4,...

f 13,11,9,7,5,...

g 6,4.8,3.6,2.4,1.2,...

h 2.3,1.1,-0.1,-1.3,...

2 Find the next three terms in each of the following sequences and explain the rule that you used in each case.

a 1,-3,9,-27,...

b Mo, Tu, We, Th, ...

c a,c,f,j,o,...

# INVESTIGATION

3 The first term  $(T_{1})$  of a sequence is 5. The term-to-term rule for the sequence is 'add  $x$ '.

Find the value of  $x$  that will give you each of these sequences:

a every second term is not an integer  
b every second term is a multiple of 10.  
c  $\mathrm{T}_2 <   \mathrm{T}_1$

# Relating a term to its position in the sequence

The term-to-term rule is useful for finding the next few terms in a sequence. However, if you are asked to find the 20th term or the 100th term it is not efficient to list all the terms. If you can work out an algebraic rule for generating the terms you can use it to find the value of a term in any position.

To find the rule you have to work systematically with the term number and the value of each term. Tables are very useful for doing this.

This table shows the term number and the value of the first five terms in a sequence.

<table><tr><td>Term number (n)</td><td>1</td><td>2</td><td>3</td><td>4</td><td>5</td></tr><tr><td>Term</td><td>5</td><td>8</td><td>11</td><td>14</td><td>17</td></tr></table>

You can see that the difference between the terms is 3. This tells you something about the algebraic rule.

If you multiply each term number  $(n)$  by 3, you get:

<table><tr><td>Term number (n)</td><td>1</td><td>2</td><td>3</td><td>4</td><td>5</td></tr><tr><td>Term</td><td>5</td><td>8</td><td>11</td><td>14</td><td>17</td></tr><tr><td>3 × n</td><td>3</td><td>6</td><td>9</td><td>12</td><td>15</td></tr></table>

By comparing the value of each term with the value of  $3n$ , you can see that the term is 2 more than  $3n$  each time.

This means that each term is  $3 \times n + 2$  or  $3n + 2$ .

This is called a position-to-term rule.

An expression for the term in position  $n$  is called the  $n$ th term (or general term). So for this sequence the  $n$ th term  $= 3n + 2$ .

Notice that the common difference between each term in the sequence is the value that is multiplying  $n$  (the coefficient of  $n$ ) in the  $n$ th term rule. This happens with any sequence for which you move from one term to the next by adding (or subtracting) a fixed number.

You can use this rule to find the term in any position by substituting the value of  $n$  into the rule. For example:

the 45th term  $= 3(45) + 2 = 137$

the 90th term  $= 3(90) + 2 = 272$

# WORKED EXAMPLE 1

a Find the general rule for the nth term of this sequence.

2,6,10,14,18,22,26,...

b Find the 40th term of the sequence.  
c Explain how you know that the number 50 is in the sequence and work out which position it is in.  
d Explain how you know that the number 125 is not in the sequence.

# Answers

![](images/65d9fe224fce9dfeee80e9aec53c4cbd6f33cb7c48c2d501bc8dc60260630eb9.jpg)

The common difference between terms is  $+4$ , so  $4 \times n$  will appear in the rule. Make a table to show the position of each term and include the values for  $4n$ .

<table><tr><td>n</td><td>1</td><td>2</td><td>3</td><td>4</td><td>5</td><td>6</td></tr><tr><td>Term</td><td>2</td><td>6</td><td>10</td><td>14</td><td>18</td><td>22</td></tr><tr><td>4n</td><td>4</td><td>8</td><td>12</td><td>16</td><td>20</td><td>24</td></tr></table>

Each term is 2 less than  $4n$ , so the rule for the nth term is  $4n - 2$ .

b 40th term  $\therefore n = 40$

To find the 40th term in the sequence substitute

$$
4 \times 4 0 - 2 = 1 5 8
$$

$n = 40$  into the nth term formula.

c  $4n - 2 = 50$

If the number 50 is in the sequence there must be a value of  $n$  for which  $4n - 2 = 50$ . Rearrange the rule to make  $n$  the subject.

$$
4 n - 2 = 5 0
$$

$$
4 n = 5 2
$$

$$
n = \frac {5 2}{4} = 1 3
$$

Add 2 to both sides.

Divide both sides by 4.

# WORKED EXAMPLE 1 CONTINUED

Since this has given a whole number, 50 must be the  $13^{\text{th}}$  term in the sequence.

d  $4n - 2 = 125$

If the number 125 is in the sequence then there must be a value of  $n$  for which  $4n - 2 = 125$ . Rearrange to make  $n$  the subject.

$$
4 n = 1 2 7
$$

Add 2 to both sides.

$$
n = \frac {1 2 7}{4} = 3 1. 7 5
$$

Divide both sides by 4.

Since  $n$  is the position in the sequence it must be a whole number and it is not in this case. This means that 125 cannot be a number in the sequence.

# TIP

There are other ways of knowing that 125 is not in the sequence. For example, you can see that  $4n - 2$  is always an even number, but 125 is odd, so it cannot appear in the sequence. It is important, though, for you to understand how to use algebra to answer parts (c) and (d) because when sequences become more complicated you may have to use algebra.

Worked example 2 shows you how to find an expression for the  $n$ th term when there is no common difference between the terms.

# WORKED EXAMPLE 2

Find an expression for the nth term of the sequence 2, 5, 10, 17, 26 ...

# Answer

Work out the difference between terms in the sequence. This is known as the first difference.

![](images/3cd5aeb32df8100ddc3a940b47eacbb815e78763b932946faad57e657bbcb255.jpg)

The first difference is not constant so work out the second difference:

![](images/81450af1377167d9ecd59acbf7c58b2ccf09692c114eba7f696589ffedc6852d.jpg)

The second difference is constant. This means the sequence is quadratic and the rule will involve  $n^2$ .

# TIP

You may recognise that the numbers in this sequence are all 1 greater than the sequence of square numbers and be able to answer the question by inspection.

# WORKED EXAMPLE 2 CONTINUED

Make a table to show the position of each term and include a row for the values of  $n^2$ .

<table><tr><td>n</td><td>1</td><td>2</td><td>3</td><td>4</td><td>5</td></tr><tr><td>Term</td><td>2</td><td>5</td><td>10</td><td>17</td><td>26</td></tr><tr><td>n2</td><td>1</td><td>4</td><td>9</td><td>16</td><td>25</td></tr></table>

Each term is 1 greater than the value of  $n^2$ , so the  $n$ th term is  $n^2 + 1$ .

All quadratic sequences have a constant second difference.

If the sequence is cubic it will have a constant third difference and the rule for the sequence will involve  $n^3$ .

The general term of a quadratic sequence is in the form  $an^2 + bn + c$ .

This table shows the first four terms in the general sequence and their first and second differences.

<table><tr><td>n</td><td>1</td><td>2</td><td>3</td><td>4</td></tr><tr><td>Term</td><td>a + b + c</td><td>4a + 2b + c</td><td>9a + 3b + c</td><td>16a + 4b + c</td></tr><tr><td>1st difference</td><td>3a + b</td><td>5a + b</td><td>7a + b</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>2nd difference</td><td>2a</td><td>2a</td><td></td><td></td></tr></table>

The table shows that for any quadratic sequence:

the 1st term is  $a + b + c$  
the 2nd term minus the 1st term  $(\mathrm{T}_2 - \mathrm{T}_1)$  is  $3a + b$  
the 2nd difference is  $2a$

This gives us a way to work out the general term for complex quadratic sequences.

# WORKED EXAMPLE 3

Find the nth term of the quadratic sequence 2, 8, 16, 26, 38 ...

# Answer

![](images/98ffe7fe0ca95734f3b80981369ff21b5994dc38f3eca35922b722aead8454a4.jpg)

Once you have values for each expression you can make equations to find  $a$ ,  $b$ , and  $c$ .

$$
2 a = 2, \text {s o} a = 1
$$

Find the value of a first.

$$
3 a + b = 6
$$

Find b by substituting the value of a.

$$
3 (1) + b = 6, \text {s o} b = 3
$$

# TIP

If you are not told the sequence is quadratic, you will need to check that the second difference is constant before using this method.

# WORKED EXAMPLE 3 CONTINUED

$a + b + c = 2$ $1 + 3 + c = 2$  Find c by substituting the values of a and b.

$$
4 + c = 2, \text {s o} c = - 2
$$

The nth term is  $n^2 + 3n - 2$  Insert the values of  $a$ ,  $b$  and  $c$  into the general term  $an^2 + bn + c$ .

# Exponential sequences

Consider the sequence 20, 100, 500, 2500 ...

You find each term by multiplying the previous term by 5. This type of sequence is called an exponential sequence and expression for the  $n$ th term will involve an exponent (in terms of  $n$ ).

Listing the terms can help you find the rule:

T2 20×5

T3 20×5×5=20×5²

T 20×5×5×5=20×5

You can see that for each term the exponent is one less than the term number.

So for the nth term, the exponent will be  $n - 1$ :

T 20×5n-1

In general terms, for any geometric sequence with a common ratio  $r$  and the first term  $a$ , we can say the  $n$ th term  $= a \times r^{n-1}$ .

# Combinations of sequences

If you add or subtract equivalent terms of two or more sequences together to form a new sequence then you can find the  $n$ th term of this new sequence by adding or subtracting the  $n$ th terms of the original sequences.

# WORKED EXAMPLE 4

Complete this table of sequences.

# MATHEMATICAL CONNECTIONS

You will work with these types of sequences involving real-life situations such as population growth, compound interest and depreciation when you deal with growth and decay in Chapter 17.

# WORKED EXAMPLE 4 CONTINUED

# Answer

The terms in sequence A go up by 3 each time. It is a linear sequence with common difference 3 and  $n$ th term  $3n + 2$ .

The terms in sequence B are each 1 greater than the square number sequence. So the nth term is  $n^2 + 1$ .

In sequence C, each term is found by adding the equivalent terms of sequence A and B together:  $5 + 2 = 7$ ,  $8 + 5 = 13$ , and so on. You can find the nth term in a similar way.

The completed table is:

<table><tr><td>Sequence</td><td>1st term</td><td>2nd term</td><td>3rd term</td><td>4th term</td><td></td><td>nth term</td></tr><tr><td>A</td><td>5</td><td>8</td><td>11</td><td>14</td><td></td><td>3n + 2</td></tr><tr><td>B</td><td>2</td><td>5</td><td>10</td><td>17</td><td></td><td>n2 + 1</td></tr><tr><td>C</td><td>7</td><td>13</td><td>21</td><td>31</td><td></td><td>n2 + 3n + 3</td></tr></table>

# Generating sequences from patterns

The diagram shows a pattern using matches.

Pattern 1

The table shows the number of matches for the first five patterns.

<table><tr><td>Pattern number (n)</td><td>1</td><td>2</td><td>3</td><td>4</td><td>5</td></tr><tr><td>Number of matches</td><td>3</td><td>5</td><td>7</td><td>9</td><td>11</td></tr></table>

Notice that the pattern number can be used as the position number,  $n$ , and that the numbers of matches form a sequence, just like those considered in the previous section.

The number added on each time is two but you could also see that this was true from the original diagrams. This means that the number of matches for pattern  $n$  is the same as the value of the  $n$ th term of the sequence.

The nth term will therefore be:  $2n \pm$  something.

Use the ideas from the previous section to find the value of the 'something'.

Taking any term in the sequence from the table, for example the first:

$n = 1$  , so  $2n = 2\times 1 = 2$  . But the first term is 3, so you need to add 1.

So, nth term  $= 2n + 1$

Which means that, if you let  $m$  be the number of matches in pattern  $n$  then,  $m = 2n + 1$ .

# WORKED EXAMPLE 5 CONTINUED

b  $4p$  is in the formula

Notice that the number of squares increases by 4 from shape to shape.

This means that there will be a term  $4p^{\prime}$  in the formula.

$$
\begin{array}{l} \text {I f} p = 1 \text {t h e n} 4 p = 4 \\ 4 + 3 = 7 \\ s o, s = 4 p + 3 \\ \end{array}
$$

Now, if  $p = 1$  then  $4p = 4$ . The first term is 7, so you need to add 3.

This means that  $s = 4p + 3$ .

$$
\text {I f} p = 5 \text {t h e n}
$$

$$
4 p + 3 = 2 0 + 3 = 2 3,
$$

the rule is correct.

Check: if  $p = 5$  then there should be 23

squares, which is correct.

c For pattern 100,  $p = 100$  and  $s = 4 \times 100 + 3 = 403$ .

Notice that  $p$  has been used for the pattern number rather than  $n$  here. You can use any letters that you like – it doesn't have to be  $n$  every time.

# Subscript notation

The  $n$ th term of a sequence can be written as  $u_n$ . This is called subscript notation and  $u$  represents a sequence. You read this as '  $u$  sub  $n$ '. Terms in a specific position (for example, the first, second and hundredth term) are written as  $u_1, u_2, u_{100}$  and so on.

Term-to-term rules and position-to-term rules may be given using subscript notation. You can work out the value of any term or the position of a term by substituting known values into the rules.

# WORKED EXAMPLE 6

The position to term rule for a sequence is given as  $u_n = 3n - 1$ .

What are the first three terms of the sequence?

# Answer

Substitute  $n = 1$ ,  $n = 2$  and  $n = 3$  into the rule.

$$
u _ {1} = 3 (1) - 1 = 2 \quad \text {F o r t h e f i r s t t e r m ,} n = 1
$$

$$
u _ {2} = 3 (2) - 1 = 5
$$

$$
u _ {3} = 3 (3) - 1 = 8
$$

The first three terms are 2, 5 and 8.

# WORKED EXAMPLE 7

The number 149 is a term in the sequence defined as  $u_{n} = n^{2} + 5$ .

Which term in the sequence is 149?

# Answer

$149 = n^{2} + 5$  Find the value of  $n$  when  $u_{n} = 149$

$$
1 4 9 - 5 = n ^ {2}
$$

$144 = n^{2}$ $n^2 = 144$  has solutions  $n = 12$  and

12 = n  $n = -12$  but we cannot have a -12th term so  $n = 12$

149 is the 12th term in the sequence.

# 9.2 Rational and irrational numbers

You already know about decimals and how they are used to write down numbers that are not whole. Some of these numbers can be expressed as fractions, for example:

$$
0. 5 = \frac {1}{2}
$$

$$
2. 5 = \frac {5}{2}
$$

$$
0. 1 2 5 = \frac {1}{8}
$$

$$
0. 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 \dots = \frac {1}{3}
$$

and so on.

Any number that can be expressed as a fraction is known as a rational number. If you cannot express the number as a fraction, it is an irrational number.

Notice that there are two types of rational number: terminating decimals (i.e. those with a decimal part that doesn't continue forever) and recurring decimals (the decimal part continues forever but repeats itself at regular intervals). Irrational numbers produce decimals that have non-repeating, non-terminating decimal parts.

Recurring decimals can be expressed by using a dot above the repeating digit(s):

$$
0. 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 \dots = 0. \dot {3}
$$

$$
0. 3 0 2 3 0 2 3 0 2 3 0 2 \dots = 0. \dot {3} 0 \dot {2}
$$

$$
0. 4 5 4 5 4 5 4 5 4 \dots = 0. \dot {4} \dot {5}
$$

# TIP

At this level, it is fine to simply say that a rational number can be expressed as a fraction. However, when mathematicians use the definition of rational number to prove that some numbers are irrational, they need to say that the fraction is expressed in its lowest terms.

# Exercise 9.5

5 Mathematicians also talk about imaginary numbers. Find out what these are and give one example.

# Converting recurring decimals to fractions

What can we do with a decimal that continues forever but does repeat?

Is this kind of number rational or irrational?

As an example we will look at the number 0.4.

We can use algebra to find another way of writing this recurring decimal:

Let

$$
x = 0. \dot {4} = 0. 4 4 4 4 4 4 \dots
$$

Then

$$
1 0 x = 4. 4 4 4 4 4 4 \dots
$$

We can then subtract  $x$  from  $10x$  like this:

$$
\begin{array}{l} 1 0 x = 4. 4 4 4 4 4 4 \dots \\ x = 0. 4 4 4 4 4 4 \dots \\ \end{array}
$$

$$
\begin{array}{l} 9 x = 4 \\ \Rightarrow x = \frac {4}{9} \\ \end{array}
$$

This example shows that you can write the recurring decimal 0.4 as a fraction. This means that 0.4 is a rational number.

Remember that the dot above one digit means that you have a recurring decimal. If more than one digit repeats we place a dot above the first and last repeating digit. For example, 0.418 is the same as 0.418418418418418... and 0.342 = 0.3422222222...

Every recurring decimal is a rational number. It is always possible to write a recurring decimal as a fraction.

# WORKED EXAMPLE 8

Use algebra to write each of the following as fractions. Simplify your fractions as far as possible.

a 0.3

b 0.24

c 0.934

d 0.524

# Answers

a

$$
\begin{array}{l} x = 0. 3 3 3 3 3 \dots \\ 1 0 x = 3. 3 3 3 3 3 \dots \\ \end{array}
$$

Write your recurring decimal in algebra. It is easier to see how the algebra works if you write the number out to a handful of decimal places.

Subtract:

$$
\begin{array}{l} 1 0 x = 3. 3 3 3 3 3 \dots \\ x = 0. 3 3 3 3 3 \dots \\ \end{array}
$$

Multiply by 10, so that the recurring digits still line up.

$$
\begin{array}{l} \overline {{9 x = 3}} \\ \Rightarrow x = \frac {3}{9} = \frac {1}{3} \\ \end{array}
$$

Subtract.

Divide by 9.

b

then,  $100x = 24.242424\ldots$

$$
\begin{array}{l} \text {L e t} x = 0. 2 4 2 4 2 4 \dots \tag {1} \\ 9 9 x = 2 4. 2 4 - 0. 2 4 \\ 9 9 x = 2 4 \\ s o, x = \frac {2 4}{9 9} = \frac {8}{3 3} \\ \end{array}
$$

(2)

Multiply by 100.

Subtract (2) - (1).

Divide both sides by 99.

Notice that you multiply by 100 to make sure that the 2s and 4s start in the correct place after the decimal point.

c  $x = 0.934934\dots$

$$
\begin{array}{l} 1 0 0 0 x = 9 3 4. 9 3 4 9 3 4 \dots \\ 1 0 0 0 x = 9 3 4. 9 3 4 9 3 4 \dots \\ x = 0. 9 3 4 9 3 4 \dots \\ 9 9 9 x = 9 3 4 \\ \Rightarrow x = \frac {9 3 4}{9 9 9} \\ \end{array}
$$

This time we have three recurring digits. To make sure that these line up we multiply by 1000, so that all digits move three places.

Notice that the digits immediately after the decimal point for both  $x$  and  $1000x$  are 9, 3 and 4 in the same order.

# TIP

Sometimes you may see irrational numbers shown with a bar above the recurring digits. For example,  $3.265 = 3.265656565\ldots$

# WORKED EXAMPLE 8 CONTINUED

0.524444444

$$
1 0 0 x = 5 2. 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 \dots
$$

$$
1 0 0 0 x = 5 2 4. 4 4 4 4 4 4 \dots
$$

$$
1 0 0 0 x = 5 2 4. 4 4 4 4 4 4 \dots
$$

$$
1 0 0 x = 5 2. 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 \dots
$$

$$
9 0 0 x = 4 7 2
$$

$$
\Rightarrow x = \frac {4 7 2}{9 0 0} = \frac {1 1 8}{2 2 5}
$$

Multiply by 100 so that the recurring digits begin immediately after the decimal point.

Then proceed as in the first example, multiplying by a further 10 to move the digits one place.

Subtract and simplify.

In this method you need to subtract two different numbers in such a way that the recurring part disappears. This means that sometimes you have to multiply by 10, sometimes by 100, sometimes by 1000, depending on how many digits repeat.

# 9.3 Surds

Some number have roots that can be written as rational numbers. For example,  $\sqrt{4} = 2$ ,  $\sqrt[3]{216} = 6$  and  $\sqrt{2.25} = 1.5$ .

Roots that cannot be written as rational numbers are called surds.  $\sqrt{2}, \sqrt[3]{7}$  and  $\sqrt{2.2}$  are all surds. For any root, if  $\sqrt[x]{x}$  is an irrational number, the root is a surd.

A surd is an exact value. If you use a calculator to find  $\sqrt{2}$  you get an approximate value of 1.414213562 ... When you are asked for an exact value, you should leave your answer in surd form.

# MATHEMATICAL CONNECTIONS

Surds are used to calculate exact values in trigonometry and you will re-use the skills you learn here in Chapter 15. Surds may also be useful in physics when you deal with resultant forces and velocities and in electronics for determining peak-to-peak voltages. The reality, however, is that for most real-world applications, people may use surds in calculations to avoid rounding errors, but in the end they will often work with an approximate number value rather than a surd.

# WORKED EXAMPLE 9

Square ABCD has an area of  $6\mathrm{cm}^2$ . Calculate:

a the exact length of each side  
b the length of diagonal AC correct to 3 d.p.

![](images/f94989e50c9264f7265b72442b3b02948f41b48812429e9b8a54554a081b781f.jpg)

# Answers

a Area  $= s^2$  so  $s = \sqrt{6}$

You are asked for an exact length, so leave the answer as a surd.

b  $d^{2} = s^{2} + s^{2}$

ABC is a right-angled triangle, so use Pythagoras' theorem.

$$
\begin{array}{l} d ^ {2} = (\sqrt {6}) ^ {2} + (\sqrt {6}) ^ {2} \\ d ^ {2} = 6 + 6 \\ d ^ {2} = 1 2 \\ d = \sqrt {1 2} = 3. 4 6 4 \mathrm {c m} \\ \end{array}
$$

The general rules that you already know for working with roots apply to surds as well.

<table><tr><td>General rule</td><td>Examples using numbers</td></tr><tr><td>(√x)2=x</td><td>(√4)2=√4×√4=2×2=4
(√11)2=√11×√11=11</td></tr><tr><td>√x2=x</td><td>√62=√36=6</td></tr><tr><td>√x×√y=√xy</td><td>√4×√16=2×4=8
This is the same as:
√4×√16=√4×16=√64=8</td></tr><tr><td>√x÷√y=√x/y</td><td>√64÷√4=8÷2=4
√64+√4=√64/4=√16=4</td></tr></table>

You can apply these rules to simplify and manipulate surds so that you can solve problems involving exact values.

# Simplifying surds

You can simplify a surd if the number under the root sign has factors that are square numbers.

To simplify a surd, use the fact that  $\sqrt{xy} = \sqrt{x} \times \sqrt{y}$  to write the surd as a product of smaller roots, one of which is a perfect square.

$3\sqrt{7}$  is  $3 \times \sqrt{7}$  written using algebraic conventions.

# Rationalising the denominator

Here are two equivalent expressions:

$$
\frac {2}{\sqrt {3}} + \frac {1}{\sqrt {6} - \sqrt {3}} \quad \text {a n d} \quad \frac {2 \sqrt {3}}{3} + \frac {\sqrt {6} + \sqrt {3}}{3}
$$

Why is it easier to add the two terms in the second expression?

When the denominator of a fraction contains a surd, you can rewrite the fraction so that is has only rational numbers in the denominator. This is called rationalising the denominator and it means 'remove the roots from the denominator'.

Why do we do this? Rationalising the denominator is a mathematical convention, like writing a fraction in its simplest form. A fraction is not in simplest form if the denominator contains a surd. Also, if the denominators are integers it is easier to find and use common denominators.

You can use what you already know about equivalent fractions to remove surds from the denominator of an expression.

Remember:  $\sqrt{x} \times \sqrt{x} = x$ .

# TIP

Remember that multiplying a fraction by  $\frac{x}{x}$  doesn't change its value.

$$
\begin{array}{l} \text {s o} \frac {1}{2} = \frac {1}{2} \times \frac {3}{3} = \frac {3}{6} \\ \text {a n d} \frac {1}{\sqrt {2}} = \frac {1}{\sqrt {2}} \times \frac {\sqrt {2}}{\sqrt {2}} \\ = \frac {\sqrt {2}}{2} \\ \end{array}
$$

43 You only need to multiply by the irrational part of the denominator.

$$
= \frac {4 \sqrt {3}}{9}
$$

You can also rationalise the denominator of expressions of the form  $\frac{k}{a + \sqrt{b}}$  or  $\frac{k}{a - \sqrt{b}}$ .  $(\sqrt{a} + \sqrt{b}) \times (\sqrt{a} - \sqrt{b})$  gives  $(\sqrt{a})^2 - (\sqrt{b})^2$ , which is equal to  $a - b$ , since  $a$  and  $b$  are the squares of  $\sqrt{a}$  and  $\sqrt{b}$ .

We call the two expressions  $(\sqrt{a} + \sqrt{b})$  and  $(\sqrt{a} - \sqrt{b})$  conjugate surds and we can use them to rationalise the denominator because their product does not contain any surd terms.

# WORKED EXAMPLE 16

Rationalise the denominator for each of the following expressions:

3 4+√2 a 2+√5 3-√7

Answers

3 3(2-√5) a 2+√5 (2+√5)(2-√5) Multiply the numerator and denominator by 2-√5.

$= 2\sqrt{5} -6$  Multiply the numerator and denominator by-1 to tidy it up.

$$
\begin{array}{l} = \frac {6 - 2 \sqrt {5}}{2 ^ {2} - (\sqrt {5}) ^ {2}} \quad \text {U s e} (\sqrt {a} + \sqrt {b}) (\sqrt {a} - \sqrt {b}) = (\sqrt {a}) ^ {2} - (\sqrt {b}) ^ {2}. \\ = \frac {6 - 2 \sqrt {5}}{4 - 5} \quad \text {S i m p l i f y .} \\ = \frac {6 - 2 \sqrt {5}}{- 1} \\ \end{array}
$$

# TIP

Rationalising the denominator can help you simplify expressions when you are asked to give an exact answer. If you are asked for an approximate value, you can use a calculator to work with the surds and you don't need to rationalise the denominator.

The lengths of the two shorter sides of a right-angled triangle are  $\sqrt{6}$  and  $\sqrt{18}$ . Calculate the exact length of the hypotenuse  $(h)$ .

Answer

$$
\begin{array}{l} h ^ {2} = (\sqrt {6}) ^ {2} + (\sqrt {1 8}) ^ {2} \quad \text {U s e P y t h a g o r a s s t h e o r e m :} \\ = 6 + 1 8 \\ = 2 4 \\ \end{array}

# REFLECTION

There is quite a lot of debate (and some disagreement!) in online forums about whether or not surds are useful in real life. Many people do, however, agree that they are useful in maths because they help to develop mathematical thinking and improve your fluency in using and applying the rules of algebra.

How does knowing rules of algebra help you to understand this section better?  
Does this section help you to understand any rules of algebra a bit better? How?

# TIP

Remember the rules for multiplying binomials:

$$
\begin{array}{l} (a + b) (a + b) \\ = a ^ {2} + 2 a b + b ^ {2} \\ \end{array}
$$

$$
\begin{array}{l} (a + b) (a - b) \\ = a ^ {2} - b ^ {2} \\ \end{array}
$$

# 9.4 Sets

A set is a list or collection of objects that share one or more characteristics. The objects in a set can be anything from numbers, letters and shapes to names, places or paintings, but there is usually something that they have in common.

The list of members or elements of a set is placed inside a pair of curly brackets  $\{\}$ .

Some examples of sets are:

{2,4,6,8,10} - the set of all even integers greater than zero but less than 11

$\{\mathbf{a},\mathbf{e},\mathbf{i},\mathbf{o},\mathbf{u}\}$  - the set of vowels

{Red, Green, Blue} - the set containing the colours red, green and blue.

We use capital letters to name sets:

If  $A$  is the set of prime numbers less than 10, then:  $A = \{2, 3, 5, 7\}$ .

If  $B$  is the set of letters in the word 'HAPPY', then:  $B = \{\mathrm{H},\mathrm{A},\mathrm{P},\mathrm{Y}\}$ .

Two sets are equal if they contain exactly the same elements, even if the order is different, so:

$\{1,2,3,4\} = \{4,3,2,1\} = \{2,4,1,3\}$  and so on.

The number of elements in a set is written as  $\mathfrak{n}(A)$ , where  $A$  is the name of the set. For example, in the set  $A = \{1, 3, 5, 7, 9\}$  there are five elements so  $\mathfrak{n}(A) = 5$ .

A set that contains no elements is known as the empty set. The symbol  $\varnothing$  is used to represent the empty set.

For example:

{odd numbers that are multiples of two} =  $\varnothing$  because no odd number is a multiple of two.

Now, if  $x$  is a member (an element) of the set  $A$  then it is written:  $x \in A$ .

If  $x$  is not a member of the set  $A$ , then it is written:  $x \notin A$ .

For example, if  $H = \{\text{Spades, Clubs, Diamonds, Hearts}\}$ , then:

Spades  $\in H$  but Turtles  $\notin H$

Some sets have a number of elements that can be counted. These are known as finite sets. If there is no limit to the number of members of a set then the set is infinite.

If  $A = \{\text{letters of the alphabet}\}$ , then  $A$  has 26 members and is finite.

If  $B = \{\mathrm{positive~integers}\}$ , then  $B = \{1,2,3,4,5,6,\ldots\}$  and is infinite.

So, to summarise:

- sets are listed inside curly brackets { }  
-  $\varnothing$  means it is an empty set.  
$a\in B$  means  $a$  is an element of the set  $B$  
-  $a \notin B$  means  $a$  is not an element of the set  $B$ .  
-  $\mathfrak{n}(A)$  is the number of elements in set  $A$ .

# LINK

Sets are often used in advanced probability theory.

# TIP

Remember the curly brackets on either side when you list a set.

# TIP

Notice, for set  $B$ , that elements of a set are not repeated.

b {Asia, Europe, Africa,...}

2,4,6,8

d {2,4,6,8,...}

e {1,2,3,4,6,12}

4 True or false?

a If  $A = \{1,2,3,4,5\}$  then  $3\notin A$  
b If  $B = \{\mathrm{primes}$  less than 10\}, then  $n(B) = 4$  
c If  $C = \{\mathrm{regular~quadrilaterals}\}$  , then square  $\in C$  
d If  $D = \{\text{paint primary colours}\}$ , then yellow  $\notin D$ .  
e If  $E = \{\mathrm{square~numbers~less~than~}100\}$  ,then  $64\in E$

# Universal sets

The following sets all have a number of things in common:

$$
M = \{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 \}
$$

$$
N = \{1, 5, 9 \}
$$

$$
O = \{4, 8, 2 1 \}
$$

All three are contained within the set of whole numbers. They are also all contained in the set of integers less than 22.

When you work with sets there is usually a 'largest' set which contains all of the sets that you are studying. This set can change according to the problem you are trying to solve.

Here, the set of integers contains all elements from  $M, N$  or  $O$ . But then so does the set of all positive integers less than 22.

Both these sets (and many more) can be used as a universal set. A universal set contains all possible elements that you would consider for a set in a particular problem. The symbol  $\mathcal{E}$  is used to mean the universal set.

# Complements

The complement of the set  $A$  is the set of all things that are in  $\mathcal{E}$  but NOT in the set  $A$ . The symbol  $A'$  is used to denote the complement of set  $A$ .

For example, if  $\mathcal{E} = \{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10\}$  and  $F = \{2, 4, 6\}$

then the complement of  $F$  would be  $F' = \{1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 9, 10\}$ .

So, in summary:

$\mathcal{E}$  represents a universal set  
$A^{\prime}$  represents the complement of set  $A$

# Unions and intersections

The union of two sets,  $A$  and  $B$ , is the set of all elements that are members of  $A$  or members of  $B$  or members of both. The symbol  $\cup$  is used to indicate union so, the union of sets  $A$  and  $B$  is written:

$A\cup B$

The intersection of two sets,  $A$  and  $B$ , is the set of all elements that are members of both  $A$  and  $B$ . The symbol  $\cap$  is used to indicate intersection so, the intersection of sets  $A$  and  $B$  is written:

A∩B

For example, if  $C = \{4, 6, 8, 10\}$  and  $D = \{6, 10, 12, 14\}$ , then:

$C\cap D =$  the set of all elements common to both  $= \{6,10\}$

$C\cup D =$  the set of all elements that are in  $C$  or  $D$  or both  $= \{4,6,8,10,12,14\}$

# Subsets

You already know that a rectangle is a type of quadrilateral and that all rectangles are quadrilaterals. If set  $A$  is the set of all quadrilaterals and set  $B$  is the set of all rectangles, then every element of  $B$  is also a member of  $A$  and, therefore,  $B$  is completely contained within  $A$ . When this happens, you can say that  $B$  is a subset of  $A$ . You write this as  $B \subseteq A$

You can reverse the  $\subseteq$  symbol, but this does not change its meaning.  $B \subseteq A$  means  $B$  is a subset of  $A$ , but so does  $A \supseteq B$ . If  $B$  is not a subset of  $A$ , you write  $B \nsubseteq A$ .

So in summary:

$\cup$  is the symbol for union  
-  $\cap$  is the symbol for intersection  
-  $B \subseteq A$  indicates that  $B$  is a subset of  $A$ .  
-  $B \notin A$  indicates that  $B$  is not a subset of  $A$ .

# TIP

Taking the union of two sets is like adding the sets together but remember you do not repeat elements within the set.

# TIP

The symbol,  $\subseteq$  has a open end and a closed end. The subset goes at the closed end.

# Venn diagrams

A Venn diagram is a graphical way of showing sets and how they relate to each other.

For example, if  $\mathcal{E} = \{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10\}$ ,  $A = \{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7\}$  and  $B = \{4, 5, 8\}$  then the Venn diagram looks like this:

![](images/1a0dabaa4ea870c305448b2e2345a59345d3cfc27d5660a38b6e3b9c0008e706.jpg)

The universal set is shown by drawing a rectangle. Each set within the universal set is shown as a circle. The intersection of the sets  $A$  and  $B$  is contained within the overlap of the circles. The union is shown by the region enclosed by at least one circle. Here are some examples of Venn diagrams and shaded regions to represent particular sets:

There are 180 students in the last year, of whom 84 study biology and chemistry only, 72 study chemistry and physics only and 81 study biology and physics only. 22 pupils study only biology, 21 study only chemistry and 20 study only physics. Use a Venn diagram to work out how many students study all three sciences.

# Set builder notation

So far, the contents of a set have either been given as a list of the elements or described by a rule (in words) that defines whether or not something is a member of the set. We can also describe sets using set builder notation. Set builder notation is a way of describing the elements of a set using the properties that each of the elements must have.

For example:

$A = \{x:x$  isanaturalnumber}

This means:

![](images/a2a8ee308b7099af5ad207984304265bbb76e310fc37e6e535dd13377541298b.jpg)

In other words, this is the set:  $A = \{1, 2, 3, 4, \ldots\}$ .

Sometimes the set builder notation contains restrictions.

For example,  $B = \{x : x \text{ is a letter of the alphabet, } x \text{ is a vowel}\}$ .

In this case, set  $B = \{\mathbf{a}, \mathbf{e}, \mathbf{i}, \mathbf{o}, \mathbf{u}\}$ .

Here is another example:

$A = \{$  integers greater than zero but less than 20\}

In set builder notation this is:

$A = \{x:x$  is an integer,  $0 <   x <   20\}$

This is read as: 'A is the set of all  $x$  such that  $x$  is an integer and  $x$  is greater than zero but less than  $20$ '.

The following examples show how this notation is used.

# WORKED EXAMPLE 21

List the members of the set  $C$  if  $C = \{x: x \in \text{primes}, 10 < x < 20\}$ .

# Answer

Read the set as: 'C is the set of all x'such that x is a member of the set of primes and x is greater than 10 but less than 20'.

The prime numbers greater than 10 but less than 20 are 11, 13, 17 and 19.

So,  $C = \{11, 13, 17, 19\}$

# WORKED EXAMPLE 22

Express the following set in set builder notation:

$D =$  (right-angled triangles)

# Answer

So,  $D = \{x : x \text{ is a triangle,}$  If  $D$  is the set of all right-angled triangles, then  $x$  has a right-angle  $D$  is the set of all  $x$  such that  $x$  is a triangle and  $x$  is right-angled.

As you can see from this last example, set builder notation can sometimes force you to write more, but this isn't always the case, as you will see in the following exercise.

# Exercise 9.13

1 Describe each of these sets using set builder notation.

a square numbers less than 101  
b days of the week  
c integers less than 0  
d whole numbers between 2 and 10  
e months of the year containing 30 days

2 Express each of the following in set builder notation.

a {2,3,4,5,6,7,8}  
b {a,e,i,o,u}  
c {n,i,c,h,o,l,a,s}  
d {2,4,6,8,10,12,14,16,18,20}  
e {1,2,3,4,6,9,12,18,36}

3 List the members of each of the following sets.

a  $\{x:x\text{is an integer,} 40 <   x <   50\}$  
b  $\{x:x$  is a regular polygon and  $x$  has no more than six sides}  
$\{x:x$  is a multiple of 3,  $16 <   x <   32\}$

4 If  $A = \{x : x \text{ is a multiple of three}\}$  and  $B = \{y : y \text{ is a multiple of five}\}$ , express  $A \cap B$  in set builder notation.  
5  $\mathcal{C} = \{y:y\text{is positive,} y\text{is an integer less than 18}\}$

$$
A = \{w: w > 5 \} \text {a n d} B = \{x: x \leqslant 5 \}
$$

a List the members of the set:

$$
i A \cap B \quad \text {i i} \quad A ^ {\prime} \quad \text {i i i} \quad A ^ {\prime} \cap B \quad \text {i v} \quad A \cap B ^ {\prime} \quad \text {v} \quad (A \cap B ^ {\prime}) ^ {\prime}
$$

b What is  $A\cup B?$  
c List the members of the set in part (b).

6 Describe each set in words and say why it's not possible to list all the members of each set.

a  $A = \{x,y:y = 2x + 4\}$  
b  $B = \{x:x^3$  is negative}

# TIP

Set builder notation is very useful when it isn't possible to list all the members of set because the set is infinite. For example, all the numbers less than -3 or all whole numbers greater than 1000.

# SUMMARY

# Do you know...?

A sequence is the elements of a set arranged in a particular order, connected by a rule.

A term is any number in a sequence.

If the position of a term in a sequence is given the letter  $n$  then a rule can be found to work out the value of the  $n$ th term.

A rational number is a number that can be written as a fraction.

An irrational number cannot be written as a fraction and will have a decimal part that continues forever without repeating.

Sunds are exact values of irrational numbers written with a root sign.

A surd is in simplest form when it has no factors that are square numbers and when the denominator of a fraction with surds is a rational number.

A set is a list or collection of objects that share a characteristic.

An element is a member of a set.

A set that contains no elements is called the empty set (2).

A universal set  $(\mathcal{E})$  contains all the possible elements appropriate to a particular problem.

The complement of a set is the elements that are not in the set  $(^{\prime})$

The elements of two sets can be combined (without repeats) to form the union of the two sets  $(\cup)$ .

The elements that two sets have in common is called the intersection of the two sets  $(\cap)$ .

A Venn diagram is a pictorial method of showing sets.

A shorthand way of describing the elements of a set is called set builder notation.

On 4 October 1957, the first artificial satellite, Sputnik, was launched. This particular satellite orbited the Earth, but many satellites that do experiments to study the upper atmosphere fly on short flights within the Earth's atmosphere. We can describe the flight path using the types of mathematical equations you will see in this chapter. This means scientists know where the rocket will be when it uses its parachute and where to recover the instruments. Similar equations can be used to describe any thrown projectile, including a ball!

# GETTING STARTED

1 A table of values gives a set of ordered pairs  $(x, y)$  that you can use to plot graphs on a coordinate grid.

<table><tr><td>x</td><td>-1</td><td>0</td><td>1</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td>y</td><td>3</td><td>4</td><td>5</td><td>6</td></tr></table>

Plot these points and draw a line through them.

2 The standard equation of a straight line graph is  $y = mx + c$ .

-  $m$  is the gradient (or steepness) of the graph.  
- c is the point where the graph crosses the y-axis (the y-intercept).  
a What is the relationship between the x- and y-values in the table in question 1?  
b What equation could you use to describe the line you get when you plot the points?

3 Look at the graph. Calculate the gradient, find the  $y$ -intercept and use these to write the equation of the straight line.

# 10.1 Straight line graphs

We use straight line graphs in many situations, for example: to solve equations; to convert between different measures; to show the distance travelled by an object moving at a constant speed; and so on.

# Using equations to plot lines

Keely owns a boat hire company. If Keely charges an initial fee of $40 to hire a boat and then $15 per hour, you can find a formula for the total cost $y after a hire time of x hours.

Total cost  $=$  initial fee  $^+$  total charge for all hours

$$
y = 4 0 + 1 5 \times x
$$

or (rearranging)

$$
y = 1 5 x + 4 0
$$

Now think about the total cost for a range of different hire times:

one hour: cost = 15 × 1 + 40 = $55

two hours: cost = 15 × 2 + 40 = $70

three hours: cost = 15 × 3 + 40 = $85

and so on.

If you put these values (and some more) into a table you can then plot a graph of the total cost against the number of hire hours:

<table><tr><td>Number of hours (x)</td><td>1</td><td>2</td><td>3</td><td>4</td><td>5</td><td>6</td><td>7</td><td>8</td><td>9</td></tr><tr><td>Total cost (y)</td><td>55</td><td>70</td><td>85</td><td>100</td><td>115</td><td>130</td><td>145</td><td>160</td><td>175</td></tr></table>

![](images/f8cc35cf2dd7a156c1d49295e83c9c3355805f0bdae6ad077ada80b313b03028.jpg)

The graph shows the total cost of the boat hire (plotted on the vertical axis) against the number of hire hours (on the horizontal axis). Notice that the points all lie on a straight line.

The formula  $y = 15x + 40$  tells you how the  $y$ -coordinates of all points on the line are related to the  $x$ -coordinates. This formula is called an equation of the line.

# MATHEMATICAL CONNECTIONS

You will recognise that some of the formulae used to describe nth terms in Chapter 9 are very similar to the equations used in this chapter.

The following worked examples show you how some more lines can be drawn from given equations.

# WORKED EXAMPLE 1

A straight line has equation  $y = 2x + 3$ . Construct a table of values for  $x$  and  $y$  and draw the line on a labelled pair of axes. Use integer values of  $x$  from -3 to 2.

# Answer

Substituting the values  $-3, -2, -1, 0, 1$  and 2 into the equation gives the values in the following table:

<table><tr><td>x</td><td>-3</td><td>-2</td><td>-1</td><td>0</td><td>1</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td>y</td><td>-3</td><td>-1</td><td>1</td><td>3</td><td>5</td><td>7</td></tr></table>

Notice that the  $y$ -values range from  $-3$  to  $7$ , so your  $y$ -axis should allow for this.

![](images/221bb6fa145c0c47944712b720bb9b41aa36d4ea8d1aed30fd1fc1e15f71a976.jpg)

# WORKED EXAMPLE 2

Draw the line with equation  $y = -x + 3$  for  $x$ -values from -2 to 5.

# Answer

The table for this line is:

<table><tr><td>x</td><td>-2</td><td>-1</td><td>0</td><td>1</td><td>2</td><td>3</td><td>4</td><td>5</td></tr><tr><td>y</td><td>5</td><td>4</td><td>3</td><td>2</td><td>1</td><td>0</td><td>-1</td><td>-2</td></tr></table>

![](images/75b96a32ef9e651bb3621dc6d116248838adf39307a9c240e6756abbdcf17c3c.jpg)

To draw a graph from its equation:

- construct a table of values and fill in the  $x$ - and  $y$ -coordinates of at least three points (although you may be given more)  
- draw and label your set of axes for the range of  $y$ -values you have worked out.  
- plot each point on the number plane  
- draw a straight line to join the points (use a ruler).

# TIP

Before drawing your axes, always check that you know the range of y-values that you need to use.

# Exercise 10.1

1 Make a table for  $x$  -values from  $-3$  to 3 for each of the following equations. Plot the coordinates on separate pairs of axes and draw the lines.

a  $y = {3x} + 2$

b  $y = x + 2$

$y = 2x - 1$

d  $y = 5x - 4$

e  $y = -2x + 1$

f  $y = -x - 2$

$y = 6 - x$

[y = {3x} + \frac{1}{2}]

i  $y = \frac{1}{2} x + 1$

j  $y = 4x$

k  $y = -3$

$y =  - 1 - x$

m  $x + y = 4$

n  $x - y = 2$

$y = x$

P  $y = -x$

2 Plot the lines  $y = 2x, y = 2x + 1, y = 2x - 3$  and  $y = 2x + 2$  on the same pair of axes. Use  $x$ -values from -3 to 3. What do you notice about the lines that you have drawn?  
3 For each of the following equations, construct a table of  $x$ -values for -3, 0 and 3. Complete the table of values and plot the graphs on the same set of axes.

a  $y = x + 2$

b  $y = -x + 2$

c  $y = x - 2$

d  $y = -x - 2$

4 Use your graphs from question 3 above to answer these questions.

Where do the graphs cut the  $x$  -axis?  
b Which graphs slope up to the right?  
c Which graphs slope down to the right?  
d Which graphs cut the  $y$  -axis at (0, 2)?  
e Which graphs cut the  $y$  -axis at  $(0, - 2)?$  
f Does the point (3, 3) lie on any of the graphs? If so, which?  
9 Which graphs are parallel to each other?  
h Compare the equations of graphs that are parallel to each other. How are they similar? How are they different?

# Gradient

The gradient of a line tells you how steep the line is. For every one unit moved to the right, the gradient will tell you how much the line moves up (or down). When straight lines are parallel to each other, they have the same gradient.

# Vertical and horizontal lines

Look at the two graphs shown in the following diagram:

![](images/f44d6fed7127a61dfe3ecee53764e3eb6afe30a55f7afada66252a5f044856ea.jpg)

# LINK

The word 'gradient' can also be used when creating art on a computer. A colour 'gradient' refers to a gradual change from one colour to another in the same image. The relationship with mathematical gradient comes from the idea of something changing gradually over time or distance.

Every point on the vertical line has  $x$ -coordinate  $= 3$ . So the equation of the line is simply  $x = 3$ .

Every point on the horizontal line has  $y$ -coordinate  $= -2$ . So the equation of this line is  $y = -2$ .

All vertical lines are of the form:  $x =$  a number.

All horizontal lines are of the form:  $y =$  a number.

The gradient of a vertical line is undefined because the graph does not move right or left.

The gradient of a horizontal line is zero (it does not move up or down when you move to the right).

# Exercise 10.2

# LINK

It is not really sensible to talk about the gradient of a vertical line. When calculating gradients, you need to know how the y-values change with any change in  $x$ . The x values in a vertical line do not change! You will think about this idea in Chapter 18.

1 Write down the equation of each line shown in the diagram.

![](images/6b61c8f3c500235bff6356638b438b04e74bc6d2b4e5dc1c30419ad4c8b22119.jpg)

2 Draw the following graphs on the same set of axes without plotting points or drawing a table of values.

a  $y = 3$

b  $x = 3$

c  $y = -1$

d  $x = -1$

e  $y = -3$

f  $y = 4$

g  $x = \frac{1}{2}$

h  $x = -\frac{7}{2}$

A graph parallel to the  $x$  -axis which cuts the  $y$  -axis at (0, 4).

A graph parallel to the  $y$  -axis which goes through the point  $(-2,0)$

# Lines that are neither vertical nor horizontal

![](images/58943a0aa62d6940a6d4c396fbc85e55068b68eefd8ac11386fd9b6bf9c3e5f5.jpg)

The diagram shows two different lines. If you take a point A on the line and then move to the right, then: on graph (a) you need to move up to return to the line; and on graph (b) you need to move down.

The gradient of a line measures how steep the line is. You calculate it by dividing the change in the  $y$ -coordinate by the increase in the  $x$ -coordinate:

Gradient  $= \frac{y - \text{change}}{x - \text{change}}$

For graph (a): the  $y$ -change is 8 and the  $x$ -change is 2, so the gradient is  $\frac{8}{2} = 4$ .

For graph (b): the  $y$ -change is  $-9$  (negative because you need to move down to return to the line) and the  $x$ -change is 4, so the gradient is  $\frac{-9}{4} = -2.25$ .

It is essential that you think about  $x$ -changes only. Whether the  $y$ -change is positive or negative tells you what the sign of the gradient will be.

# MATHEMATICAL CONNECTIONS

You will deal with gradient as a rate of change when you work with kinematic graphs in Chapter 21.

# TIP

Another good way to remember the gradient formula is 'rise'. The 'run' must always be to the right (increase x).

# TIP

When the  $x$ -increase is 0, the line is vertical and the gradient is undefined.

Answer

Think about where the points will be, in relation to each other, on a pair of axes. You don't need to draw this accurately, but the diagram will give you an idea of how the line may appear. Gradient  $= \frac{12}{4} = 3$

# REFLECTION

The formula for gradient involves fractions and subtractions. It is very easy to accidentally write the fractions 'upside down' or to calculate the wrong sign. How can you make sure you avoid making these mistakes?

# INVESTIGATION

Before you read on, look at the gradients you calculated in Exercise 10.3. You should be able to work out the equation of a line by considering the connection between  $x$ - and  $y$ -coordinates of groups of points. Can you see a relationship between the gradient and the equation? You will look at this in more detail in the next section, but try to work it out before you read on.

# Finding the equation of a line

Look at the three lines shown below.

C

Check for yourself that the lines have the following gradients:

gradient of line  $(\mathbf{a}) = 3$

gradient of line  $(\mathbf{b}) = -2$

gradient of line (c) = 1/2

Notice that the gradient of each line is equal to the coefficient of  $x$  in the equation and that the point at which the line crosses the  $y$ -axis (known as the  $y$ -intercept) has a  $y$ -coordinate that is equal to the constant term

In fact this is always true when  $y$  is the subject of the equation:

![](images/dbb59837de79629a41604185fa60502f6791608244cff8b174a56253d08d6593.jpg)

# In summary:

Equations of a straight line graph can be written in the form  $y = mx + c$  
$c$  (the constant term) tells you where the graph cuts the  $y$ -axis (the  $y$ -intercept).  
-  $m$  (the coefficient of  $x$ ) is the gradient of the graph; a negative value means the graph slopes down the to the right, a positive value means it slopes up to the right. The higher the value of  $m$ , the steeper the gradient of the graph.  
Graphs which have the same gradient are parallel to each other (therefore graphs that are parallel have the same gradient).

# MATHEMATICAL CONNECTIONS

The coefficient of  $x$  is the number in front of  $x$ , in the expression. You met the word 'coefficient' in Chapter 2 and later on you will see that the number in front of  $x^2$  in a quadratic expression is known at the 'coefficient of  $x^2$ ' and so on.

# WORKED EXAMPLE 5

Find the gradient and  $y$ -intercept of the lines given by each of the following equations.

a  $y = 3x + 4$

b  $y = 5 - 3x$

$y = \frac{1}{2} x + 9$

d  $x + y = 8$

e  $3x + 2y = 6$

# Answers

a  $y = 3x + 4$

Gradient = 3

The coefficient of  $x$  is 3.

y-intercept = 4

The constant term is 4.

b  $y = 5 - 3x$

Re-write the equation as  $y = -3x + 5$ .

Gradient = -3

The coefficient of  $x$  is -3.

y-intercept = 5

The constant term is 5.

c  $y = \frac{1}{2} x + 9$

Gradient  $= \frac{1}{2}$

y-intercept = 9

The gradient can be a fraction.

d  $x + y = 8$

Subtract  $x$  from both sides to make  $y$  the subject:  $y = -x + 8$

Gradient  $= -1$

y-intercept = 8

e  $3x + 2y = 6$

Gradient  $= -\frac{3}{2}$

y-intercept = 3

Make y the subject of the equation:

$3x + 2y = 6$

$2y = -3x + 6$

$$
y = - \frac {3}{2} x + \frac {6}{2}
$$

$$
y = - \frac {3}{2} x + 3

a Gradient  $= 6$  and the  $y$  -intercept  $= -1$

So the equation is  $y = 6x - 1$

b Gradient  $= -\frac{3}{4}$  and the  $y$ -intercept  $= 1$

So the equation is  $y = -\frac{3}{4} x + 1$

Gradient  $= \frac{6}{1} = 6$

Graph crosses y-axis at -1.

Gradient  $= -\frac{1.5}{2} = -\frac{3}{4}$

Graph crosses y-axis at 1.

TIP

You should always label your axes  $x$  and  $y$  when drawing graphs - even when they are sketches.

# Exercise 10.4

1 Find the gradient and  $y$ -intercept of the lines with the following equations. Sketch the graph in each case, taking care to show where the graph cuts the  $y$ -axis.

a  $y = 4x - 5$

b  $y = 2x + 3$

$y = -3x - 2$

d  $y = -x + 3$

e  $y = \frac{1}{3} x + 2$

$y = 6 - \frac{1}{4}x$

2 Sketch the graph of each equation. Show where the graph cuts the  $y$ -axis.

a  $x + y = 4$

b  $x + 2y = 4$

$x + \frac{y}{2} = 3$

d  $x = 4y - 2$

$x = \frac{y}{4} + 2$

${2x} - {3y} =  - 9$

3 Rearrange each equation so that it is in the form  $y = mx + c$  and then find the gradient and  $y$ -intercept of each graph.

a  $2y = x - 4$

b  $2x + y - 1 = 0$

$x = \frac{y}{2} -2$

${2x} - y - 5 = 0$

e  $2x - y + 5 = 0$

$x + 3y - 6 = 0$

$4y = 12x - 8$

4x+y=2

$y = x + 2$

$j\;\frac{y}{3} = {2x} - 4$

$k\frac{x}{2} - {4y} = {12}$

$- \frac{y}{3} = {4x} - 2$

4 Find the equation (in the form  $y = mx + c$ ) of a line which has:

a a gradient of 2 and a y-intercept of 3  
b a gradient of -3 and a  $y$  -intercept of -2  
a gradient of 3 and a  $y$  -intercept of -1  
d a  $y$  -intercept of -0.75 and a gradient of 0.75  
e a  $y$  -intercept of -2 and a gradient of 0  
a gradient of 0 and a  $y$  -intercept of 4.

5 Find the equation (in the form  $ax + by = c$ ) of a line which has:

a a gradient of  $-\frac{3}{2}$  and a  $y$ -intercept at  $(0, -0.5)$  
b a  $y$  -intercept of 2 and a gradient of  $-\frac{3}{4}$  
a y-intercept of -3 and a gradient of  $\frac{4}{8}$

6 Find an equation for each line.

7 Find the equation of the line which passes through each pair of points.

a  $A(2,3)$  and  $B(4,11)$

b  $A(4,5)$  and  $B(8, - 7)$

A(-1,-3) and  $B(4,6)$

d  $A(3, - 5)$  and  $B(7,12)$

8 Write down the equation of a line that is parallel to:

a  $y = -3x$

b  $y = 2x - 3$

$y = \frac{x}{2} + 4$

d  $y = -x - 2$

$x = 8$

f  $y = -6$

9 Which of the following lines are parallel to  $y = \frac{1}{2} x$ ?

a  $y = \frac{1}{2} x + 1$

b  $y = 2x$

$y + 1 = \frac{1}{2} x$

d  $2y + x = -6$

$y = 2x - 4$

10 Find the equation of a line parallel to  $y = 2x + 4$  which:

has a  $y$  -intercept of -2

b passes through the origin.

c passes through the point  $(0, - 4)$

has a  $y$  -intercept of  $\frac{1}{2}$

11 A graph has the equation  $3y - 2x = 9$

a Write down the equation of one other graph that is parallel to this one.

b Write down the equation of one other graph that crosses the  $y$ -axis at the same point as this one.

c Write down the equation of a line that passes through the  $y$ -axis at the same point as this one and which is parallel to the  $x$ -axis.

# Perpendicular lines

You have already seen that parallel lines have the same gradient and that lines with the same gradient are parallel.

Perpendicular lines meet at right angles. The product of the gradients is  $-1$ .

So,  $m_{1} \times m_{2} = -1$ , where  $m$  is the gradient of each line.

The sketch shows two perpendicular graphs.

$$
y = - \frac {1}{3} x + 2 \text {h a s a g r a d i e n t o f} - \frac {1}{3}
$$

$$
y = 3 x - 4 \text {h a s a g r a d i e n t o f 3}
$$

The product of the gradients is

$$
- \frac {1}{3} \times 3 = - 1.
$$

![](images/432615339f5b5e077b62721918a7d266a6372fc587adaf49a79c43971ab19a32.jpg)

# TIP

Remember that a product is the result of multiplying two numbers together.

# TIP

If the product of the gradients of two lines is equal to  $-1$ , it follows that the lines are perpendicular to each other.

# INVESTIGATION

In two dimensions, straight lines that are not parallel always meet at one point. Is this true in three dimensions?

# WORKED EXAMPLE 7

Given that  $y = \frac{2}{3} x + 2$ , determine the equation of the straight line that is:

a perpendicular to this line and which passes through the origin.  
b perpendicular to this line and which passes through the point  $(-3,1)$ .

# Answers

a  $y = mx + c$

$$
\begin{array}{l} m = - \frac {3}{2} \\ c = 0 \\ \end{array}
$$

The gradient is the negative reciprocal

$$
\text {o f} \frac {2}{3}.
$$

The equation of the line is

$$
y = - \frac {3}{2} x.
$$

b  $y = -\frac{3}{2} x + c$

$$
\begin{array}{l} x = - 3 \text {a n d} y = 1 \\ 1 = - \frac {3}{2} (- 3) + c \\ 1 = \frac {9}{2} + c \\ c = - 3 \frac {1}{2} \\ y = - \frac {3}{2} x - 3 \frac {1}{2} \\ \end{array}
$$

Using  $m = -\frac{3}{2}$  from part (a).

Substitute the values of  $x$  and  $y$  for the

given point to solve for  $c$ .

# Exercise 10.5

1 A line perpendicular to  $y = \frac{x}{5} + 3$  passes through (1, 3).

What is the equation of the line?

2 Show that the line through the points  $A(6,0)$  and  $B(0,12)$  is:

a perpendicular to the line through  $P(8,10)$  and  $O(4,8)$  
b perpendicular to the line through  $M(-4, - 8)$  and  $N\left(-1, - \frac{13}{2}\right)$

3 Given  $A(0,0)$  and  $B(1,3)$ , find the equation of the line perpendicular to  $AB$  with a  $y$ -intercept of 5.  
4 Find the equation of the following lines:

a perpendicular to  $2x - y - 1 = 0$  and passing through  $\left(2, - \frac{1}{2}\right)$  
b perpendicular to  $2x + 2y = 5$  and passing through  $(1, -2)$ .

5 Line  $A$  joins the points (6, 0) and (0, 12) and line  $B$  joins the points (8, 10) and (4, 8). Determine the gradient of each line and state whether line  $A$  is perpendicular to line  $B$ .  
6 Show that points  $A(-3, 6)$ ,  $B(-12, -4)$  and  $C(8, -5)$  cannot be the vertices of a rectangle  $ABCD$ .  
7 Find the equation of the line that is the perpendicular bisector of the line joining the following points.

a (7,4) and (2,5)  
b (3, -3) and (1, -1)  
c (4, -2) and (4, 4)

8 A line is drawn from  $P(1,3)$  to  $Q(-3,5)$ . Find the equation of line  $MN$ , the perpendicular bisector of  $PQ$ . Give your answer in the form  $ax + by + c = 0$ , where  $a, b$  and  $c$  are integers.

# TIP

The perpendicular bisector is the line that is perpendicular to the original line and passes through its midpoint.

# Intersection with the  $x$ -axis

So far you have only found the  $y$ -intercept, either from the graph or from the equation. There is, of course, an  $x$ -intercept too. The following sketch shows the line with equation  $y = 3x - 6$ .

![](images/864d934ee23dbb0c9377a202c4f4c295ffd42da75ea618bbd75aaefe14f59962.jpg)

Notice that the line crosses the  $x$ -axis at the point where  $x = 2$  and, importantly,  $y = 0$ . In fact, all points on the  $x$ -axis have  $y$ -coordinate  $= 0$ .

If you substitute  $y = 0$  into the equation of the line:

$$
\begin{array}{l} y = 3 x - 6 \\ 0 = 3 x - 6 \quad \left(\text {p u t} y = 0\right) \\ 3 x = 6 \quad \text {(a d d 6 t o b o t h s i d e s)} \\ x = 2 \quad \text {(d i v i d e b o t h s i d e s b y 3)} \\ \end{array}
$$

This is exactly the answer that you found from the graph.

You can also find the  $y$ -intercept by putting  $x = 0$ . The following worked examples show calculations for finding both the  $x$ - and  $y$ -intercepts.

# WORKED EXAMPLE 8

Find the  $x$ - and  $y$ -intercepts for each of the following lines. Sketch the graph in each case.

a  $y = 6x - 12$  
b  $y = -x + 3$  
$2x + 5y = 20$

# Answers

a  $y = 6x - 12$

$$
\begin{array}{l} x = 0 \Rightarrow y = - 1 2 \\ y = 0 \Rightarrow 6 x - 1 2 = 0 \\ \Rightarrow x = 2 \\ \end{array}
$$

b  $y = -x + 3$

$$
\begin{array}{l} x = 0 \Rightarrow y = 3 \\ y = 0 \Rightarrow - x + 3 = 0 \\ \Rightarrow x = 3 \\ \end{array}

$2x + 5y = 20$

$$
\begin{array}{l} x = 0 \Rightarrow 5 y = 2 0 \\ \Rightarrow y = 4 \\ \end{array}
$$

$$
\begin{array}{l} y = 0 \Rightarrow 2 x = 2 0 \\ \Rightarrow x = 1 0 \\ \end{array}

# MATHEMATICAL CONNECTIONS

The  $y$  -intercept is also very important. You met it earlier in the chapter. The  $c^{\prime}$  in the equation  $y = mx + c$  is the  $y$  -intercept.

You will need to understand this method when solving simultaneous equations in Chapter 14.

# Finding the length of a straight line segment

Although lines are infinitely long, you are usually only interested in a part of a line. Any section of a line joining two points is called a line segment.

# MATHEMATICAL CONNECTIONS

The word 'segment' means 'part'. You have seen this word used in Chapter 3, where a segment of a circle is the part of a circle 'cut off' by a chord.

If you know the coordinates of the end points of a line segment you can use Pythagoras' theorem to calculate the length of the line segment.

# Answer

$$
\begin{array}{l} a ^ {2} = 8 ^ {2} + 6 ^ {2} \\ a ^ {2} = b ^ {2} + c ^ {2} (\text {P y t h a g o r a s} ^ {\prime} \text {t h e o r e m}) \\ \end{array}

$$
a ^ {2} = 6 4 + 3 6

Work out each expression.

$$
a ^ {2} = 1 0 0

$$
\therefore a = \sqrt {1 0 0}

# MATHEMATICAL CONNECTIONS

Pythagoras' theorem is covered in more detail in Chapter 11. Remember though, that in any right-angled triangle the square on the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the squares on the other two sides. You write this as  $a^2 + b^2 = c^2$ .

# Midpoints

It is possible to find the coordinates of the midpoint of the line segment (i.e. the point that is exactly halfway between the two original points).

Consider the following line segment and the points  $A(3,4)$  and  $B(5,10)$

If you add both  $x$ -coordinates and divide by two you get  $\frac{(3 + 5)}{2} = \frac{8}{2} = 4$ .

If you add both  $y$ -coordinates and divide by two you get  $\frac{(4 + 10)}{2} = \frac{14}{2} = 7$ .

This gives a new point with coordinates (4, 7). This point is exactly halfway between  $A$  and  $B$ .

# SELF ASSESSMENT

1 Look back at the learning intentions covering straight lines at the start of this chapter. Use these to write a list of criteria that you can use to decide whether you have met the learning intentions.  
2 Once you have your list, check your work against the success criteria.

- Place a tick (✓) in the second column if you can find evidence that you have met each one. (You are looking for how your work shows you have achieved the criteria.)  
If you cannot find evidence, write down what you can do to improve in that particular area.

3 Make any improvements that you need to over the next few days and then reassess your work using the same criteria.

# MATHEMATICAL CONNECTIONS

There are several ways to find the 'centre' of a triangle. One of them is to join each vertex of the triangle to the midpoint of the opposite side. The resulting lines all cross at the same point. This point is called the 'centroid' and is the centre of gravity of the triangle if the mass is evenly spread over the whole area.

# TIP

You learnt how to create a table of success criteria in Chapter 3. Read through that section again if you need to.

# 10.2 Quadratic expressions and equations

![](images/5e69655d66cb9dd9feb3a0b070d16bfd15c0d424c427b1807431abd6909fe78f.jpg)

The diagram shows a rectangle of width  $(x + 3)$  cm and length  $(x + 5)$  cm that has been divided into smaller rectangles.

The area of the whole rectangle is equal to the sum of the smaller areas, so the area of whole rectangle  $= (x + 3) \times (x + 5)$ .

The sum of smaller rectangle areas:  $x^{2} + 3x + 5x + 15 = x^{2} + 8x + 15$ .

This means that  $(x + 3) \times (x + 5) = x^2 + 3x + 5x + 15 = x^2 + 8x + 15$  and this is true for all values of  $x$ .

Notice what happens if you multiply every term in the second bracket by every term in the first:

![](images/38bf59856e91c3067076c0b179e5575c6a21c966cc7737a1a1960468ba321eda.jpg)

Notice that the four terms in boxes are exactly the same as the four smaller areas that were calculated before.

Another way to show this calculation is to use a grid:

<table><tr><td></td><td>x</td><td>3</td></tr><tr><td>x</td><td>x2</td><td>3x</td></tr><tr><td>5</td><td>5x</td><td>15</td></tr></table>

You will notice that this is almost the same as the areas method above but it can also be used when the constants are negative, as you will see in Worked example 11.

When you remove the brackets and rewrite the algebraic expression you are expanding or multiplying out the brackets. The resulting algebraic expression contains an  $x^2$  term, an  $x$  term and a constant term. This is called a quadratic expression

# REFLECTION

How do you remember the difference between equations, expressions and formulae?

Write some short notes to help someone who finds this confusing.

The following worked example shows these methods and also a third method for expanding pairs of brackets. You should try each method when working through the next exercise and decide which you find easiest, though you will begin to notice that in fact they are all the same.

# WORKED EXAMPLE 11

Expand and simplify.

a  $(x + 2)(x + 9)$

b (x-7)(x+6)

c (2x-1)(x+9)

# Answers

a  $\left( {x + 2}\right) \left( {x + 9}\right)$

$x^{2} + 9x + 2x + 18$

$= x^{2} + 11x + 18$

In this version of the

method you will notice that the arrows have not been included and the multiplication 'arcs' have been arranged so that the are symmetrical and easy to remember.

b x -7 x x² -7x +6 6x -42

$x^{2} - 7x + 6x - 42$

$= x^{2} - x - 42$

The grid method with a

negative value.

c (2x-1)(x+9)

First:  $2x + x = 2x^{2}$

Outside:  $2x \times 9 = 18x$

Inside:  $-1 \times x = -x$

Last:  $-1 \times 9 = -9$

$2x^{2} + 18x - x - 9$

$= x^{2} + 17x - 9$

A third method uses the

mnemonic 'FOIL', which stands for First, Outside, Inside, Last. This means that you multiply the first terms in each bracket together, then the 'outside' pair together (i.e. the first term and last term), then the 'inside' pair together (i.e. the second term and third term) and finally the 'last' pair together (i.e. the second term in each bracket).

# Squaring a binomial

$$
(x + y) ^ {2} \text {m e a n s} (x + y) (x + y)
$$

To find the product, you can use the method you learnt earlier.

$$
(x + y) (x + y) = x ^ {2} + x y + x y + y ^ {2} = x ^ {2} + 2 x y + y ^ {2}
$$

However, you should be able to expand by just noticing that:

the first term is the square of the first term  $(x^{2})$  
the middle term is twice the product of the middle terms  $(2xy)$  
the last term is the square of the last term  $(y^{2})$

# REFLECTION

Many people make errors with negative signs when expanding brackets. List two things you can do to make sure you don't make those mistakes.

# MATHEMATICAL CONNECTIONS

# Factorising simple quadratic expressions

Look again at the expansion of  $(x + 2)(x + 9)$ , which gave  $x^2 + 11x + 18$ :

![](images/b2042c7ba5dcd5fdc864adc9e2ae527b69dde1789efd561439d7e2f5529eed0d.jpg)

Here the two numbers add to give the coefficient of  $x$  in the final expression and the two numbers multiply to give the constant term.

This works whenever there is just one  $x$  in each bracket.

# WORKED EXAMPLE 13

Expand and simplify.

a  $(x + 6)(x + 12)$

b  $(x + 4)(x - 13)$

# Answers

a  $(x + 6)(x + 12) = x^{2} + 18x + 72$

$6 + 12 = 18$  and  $6 \times 12 = 72$  so this gives  $18x$  and  $72$ .

b  $(x + 4)(x - 13) = x^{2} - 9x - 52$

$4 + -13 = -9$  and  $4 \times -13 = -52$  so this gives  $-9x$  and  $-52$ .

If you use the method in worked example 13 and work backwards you can see how to put a quadratic expression back into brackets. Note that the coefficient of  $x^2$  in the quadratic expression must be 1 for this to work.

Consider the expression  $x^{2} + 18x + 72$  and suppose that you want to write it in the form  $(x + a)(x + b)$ .

From the worked example you know that  $a + b = 18$  and  $a \times b = 72$ .

Now  $72 = 1 \times 72$  but these two numbers don't add up to give 18.

However,  $72 = 6 \times 12$  and  $6 + 12 = 18$ .

So,  $x^{2} + 18x + 72 = (x + 6)(x + 12)$ .

The process of putting a quadratic expression back into brackets like this is called factorisation.

# DISCUSSION 1

Talk to a partner or teacher about why this does not work if there is more than one x in either or both brackets. Try expanding some pairs of brackets to see what happens.

# MATHEMATICAL CONNECTIONS

$1 \times 72$  and  $6 \times 12$  are factor pairs of 72. You learnt about factor pairs in Chapter 1.

# WORKED EXAMPLE 14

# Answers

a  $12 = 1\times 12$

You need two numbers that multiply to give 12 and add to give 7.

$$
1 2 = 2 \times 6
$$

These don't add to give 7.

$$
1 2 = 3 \times 4 \text {a n d} 3 + 4 = 7
$$

These don't add to give 7.

$$
S _ {0}, x ^ {2} + 7 x + 1 2 = (x + 3) (x + 4)
$$

These multiply to give 12 and add to give 7.

b -8x2=-16and-8+2=-6

$$
S _ {0}, x ^ {2} - 6 x - 1 6 = (x - 8) (x + 2)
$$

You need two numbers that multiply to give -16 and add to give -6.

Since they multiply to give a negative answer, one of the numbers must be negative and the other must be positive. (Since they add to give a negative number, the larger of the two numbers must be negative.)

c  $-5\times -3 = 15$  and  $-5 + - 3 = -8$

$$
S _ {0}, x ^ {2} - 8 x + 1 5 = (x - 3) (x - 5)
$$

You need two numbers that multiply to give 15 and add to give -8. Since they multiply to give a positive value but add to give a negative then both must be negative.

d  $2x^{2} + 14x + 20$

$$
= 2 (x ^ {2} + 7 x + 1 0)
$$

$$
= 2 (x + 5) (x + 2)
$$

There is a common factor of 2 in all the terms.

Remove this then find the factors that give 7 and 10.

$$
5 \times 2 = 1 0 \text {a n d} 5 + 2 = 7
$$

# MATHEMATICAL CONNECTIONS

You have already seen in Chapter 1 that positive whole numbers are either prime or can be written as the product of two or more other numbers. The process of writing a number as a product like this is also known as 'factorisation'. In fact, factorisation is the process of writing something as the product of two or more factors in any context.

# TIP

List the factor pairs of 12.

If you spot which pair of numbers works straight away then you don't need to write out all the other factor pairs.)

# REFLECTION

When you look for your pair of integers, think about the factors of the constant term first. Then choose the pair that adds up to the  $x$  term in the right way. Write down a way to help you remember to do this.

# Difference between two squares

The very last question in the previous exercise was a special kind of quadratic.

To factorise  $x^{2} - 100$  you must notice that  $x^{2} - 100 = x^{2} + 0x - 100$ .

Now, continuing as in Worked example 14:

$$
1 0 \times - 1 0 = - 1 0 0 \text {a n d} - 1 0 + 1 0 = 0, \text {s o} x ^ {2} + 0 x - 1 0 0 = (x - 1 0) (x + 1 0).
$$

Now think about a more general case in which you try to factorise  $x^{2} - a^{2}$ .

Notice that  $x^{2} - a^{2} = x^{2} + 0x - a^{2}$ .

Since  $a \times -a = -a$  and  $a + -a = 0$ , this leads to:

$$
x ^ {2} - a ^ {2} = (x - a) (x + a)
$$

You must remember this special case. This kind of expression is called the difference between two squares

# LINK

Although the difference between two squares may seem like a very small part of quadratic expressions it is, in fact, a very important one. Beyond Cambridge IGCSE level, mathematicians use the difference between two squares to solve advanced problems in an area of mathematics known as 'complex numbers', where we start to understand the meaning of square roots of negative numbers!

# TIP

Note that the difference 'between' two squares can also be called the difference 'of' two squares. It doesn't matter which you use.

# WORKED EXAMPLE 15

Factorise the following using the difference between two squares:

a  $x^{2} - 49$

b x²-1 4

16y²-25w²

# Answers

a  $49 = 7^{2}$

$$
\begin{array}{l} x ^ {2} - 4 9 = x ^ {2} - 7 ^ {2} \\ = (x - 7) (x + 7) \\ \end{array}
$$

Use the formula for the difference between two squares:

$$
x ^ {2} - a ^ {2} = (x - a) (x + a).
$$

You know that  $\sqrt{49} = 7$  so you can write 49 as  $7^{2}$ . This gives you  $a^2$ . Substitute  $7^2$  into the formula.

b  $\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^{2} = \frac{1}{4}$

$$
\begin{array}{l} x ^ {2} - \frac {1}{4} = x ^ {2} - \left(\frac {1}{2}\right) ^ {2} \\ = \left(x - \frac {1}{2}\right) \left(x + \frac {1}{2}\right) \\ \end{array}
$$

$\sqrt{\frac{1}{4}}$  is  $\frac{1}{2}$  so you can rewrite  $\frac{1}{4}$  as  $\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^2$

and substitute it into the formula for the difference between two squares.

$(4y)^2 = 4y \times 4y = 16y^2$  and

$$
1 6 y ^ {2} = (4 y) ^ {2}
$$

$$
(5 w) ^ {2} = 5 w \times 5 w = 2 5 w ^ {2}
$$

$$
2 5 w ^ {2} = (5 w) ^ {2}
$$

$$
1 6 y ^ {2} - 2 5 w ^ {2} = (4 y) ^ {2} - (5 w) ^ {2}
$$

Substitute in  $(4y)^2$  and  $(5w)^2$

$$
= (4 y - 5 w) (4 y + 5 w)
$$

# Perfect squares

Consider what happens when you expand expressions of the form  $(a + b)^2$  and  $(a - b)^2$ .

$$
(a + b) ^ {2} = (a + b) (a + b) = a ^ {2} + 2 a b + b ^ {2}
$$

$$
(a - b) ^ {2} = (a - b) (a - b) = a ^ {2} - 2 a b + b ^ {2}
$$

Expressions in the form  $(a + b)^2$  and  $(a - b)^2$  are perfect squares.

You can use the results of the expansions in reverse to factorise expressions that follow this pattern.

# WORKED EXAMPLE 16

# Using factors to solve quadratic equations

You can now use the factorisation method to solve some quadratic equations A quadratic equation is an equation of the form  $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$ . The method is illustrated in Worked example 17.

# WORKED EXAMPLE 17

Solve each of the following equations for  $x$ .

a  $x^{2} - 3x = 0$

b  $x^{2} - 7x + 12 = 0$

$x^{2} + 6x - 4 = 12$

d  $x^{2} - 8x + 16 = 0$

# Answers

a  $x^{2} - 3x = 0$

$$
x (x - 3) = 0
$$

Now the key point:

If two or more quantities multiply to give zero, then at least one of the quantities must be zero.

So either  $x = 0$  or  $x - 3 = 0 \Rightarrow x = 3$ .

Check:  $0^2 - 3 \times 0 = 0$  (this works).

$3^{2} - 3 \times 3 = 9 - 9 = 0$  (this also works)

In fact both  $x = 0$  and  $x = 3$  are solutions.

b  $x^{2} - 7x + 12 = 0$

$$
(x - 4) (x - 3) = 0
$$

Therefore either  $x - 4 = 0 \Rightarrow x = 4$ .

$$
\text {o r} x - 3 = 0 \Rightarrow x = 3.
$$

Again, there are two possible values of  $x$ .

Notice that both terms of the left-hand side are multiples of  $x$  so you can take out a common factor of  $x$ .

Use the factorisation method of Worked example 14 on the left-hand side of the equation.

# TIP

Where the numbers are not square, try taking a common factor out first.

# TIP

When you solve quadratic equations, you should rearrange them so that a zero appears on one side, i.e. so that they are in the form  $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$

# TIP

There are still two solutions here, but they are identical. When a quadratic equation has solutions, there are always two of them, even if they are both the same!

# WORKED EXAMPLE 17 CONTINUED

$x^{2} + 6x - 4 = 12$

$\Rightarrow x^{2} + 6x - 16 = 0$  (subtract 12 from both sides)

Factorising, you get  $(x + 8)(x - 2) = 0$

So either  $x + 8 = 0 \Rightarrow x = -8$ .

or  $x - 2 = 0\Rightarrow x = 2$

d Factorise  $x^{2} - 8x + 16 = 0$

to give  $(x - 4)(x - 4) = 0$

So either  $x - 4 = 0 \Rightarrow x = 4$ .

or  $x - 4 = 0\Rightarrow x = 4$

Of course these are both the same thing, so the only solution is  $x = 4$ .

When you rearrange some equations with fractions you get quadratic expressions and you may have to factorise those find the solutions.

# WORKED EXAMPLE 18

Solve the equation  $\frac{x}{x + 3} = \frac{8}{x + 6}$

$$
x (x + 6) = 8 (x + 3)
$$

Multiply both sides by  $(x + 6)(x + 2)$

$$
x ^ {2} + 6 x = 8 x + 2 4
$$

Expand the brackets. Note there is now a term with  $x^2$ .

$$
x ^ {2} - 2 x = 2 4
$$

Subtract 8x from both sides.

$$
x ^ {2} - 2 x - 2 4 = 0
$$

Subtract 24 from both sides.

$$
(x - 6) (x + 4) = 0
$$

Factorise the quadratic expression.

Either  $x - 6 = 0 \Rightarrow x = 6$

Or  $x + 4 = 0\Rightarrow x = -4$

# Exercise 10.12

# MATHEMATICAL CONNECTIONS

Quadratic expressions and equations have a very special place in mathematics. At the start of the chapter you saw that the motion of satellites in the Earth's atmosphere follow paths that can be described using quadratic expressions. This is true for any object you might throw, where there is gravity. Quadratic expressions are also used to describe circles algebraically, and even the orbits of planets around the Sun can be described using expressions with quadratic terms.

# Pythagoras' theorem and similar shapes

# IN THIS CHAPTER YOU WILL:

use Pythagoras' theorem to find unknown sides of right-angled triangles  
use Pythagoras' theorem to solve problems  
decide whether or not triangles are mathematically similar  
use properties of similar triangles to solve problems  
find unknown lengths in similar figures  
- use the relationship between sides and areas of similar figures to find missing values  
- recognise similar solids  
calculate the volume and surface area of similar solids  
- recognise whether shapes are congruent or not.

Pythagoras' theorem is very important in navigation. A pilot will need to use Pythagoras' theorem to calculate the distance to a landing place  $300\mathrm{km}$  west and  $200\mathrm{km}$  north. Similarly, a delivery driver looking for the most efficient route to make deliveries will often use software to work out the shortest possible distances. Pythagoras' theorem will be vital to that software.

# GETTING STARTED

1 Calculations for Pythagoras' theorem involve lots of squares and square roots. Check you know how to use the  $\sqrt{}$  button on your calculator by confirming the answers to these calculations.

a  $\sqrt{9} = 3$

b  $\sqrt{1.96} = 1.4$

c  $\sqrt{2.34} = 1.53$  (to 2 d.p.)

d  $\sqrt{9 + 16} = 5$

e  $\sqrt{25 + 144} = 13$

f  $\sqrt{6^2 + 8^2} = 10$

g  $\sqrt{15 - 6} = 3$

h  $\sqrt{10.3^3 - 8.6^2} = 5.67$  (to 2 d.p.)

i  $\sqrt{1.44} + 3.5 = 4.7$

2 Calculate the following, giving your answers to 2 decimal places unless the answer is exact.

a 121

b 6.25

c  $\sqrt{5.67}$

d  $\sqrt{32 + 17}$

e  $\sqrt{10^{2} + 24^{2}}$

f 28.1²-4.2²

3 The answers to parts (d), (e) and (f) in question 1 are all positive integers. When three positive integers  $a$ ,  $b$  and  $c$  satisfy  $a^2 + b^2 = c^2$  they are called a Pythagorean triple. Do some research to find some others and try to learn to recognise some.

4 a Copy and complete this table by substituting different values of  $a$  into the expressions.

<table><tr><td>a</td><td>b=a2-1/2</td><td>c=a2+1/2</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>5</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>7</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>9</td><td></td><td></td></tr></table>

b Test whether the sets of numbers are Pythagorean triples.  
c What happens for other odd values of a? What happens if  $a = 1$ ?

# 11.1 Pythagoras' theorem

Centuries before Pythagoras was alive, the Egyptians knew that if they tied knots in a rope at regular intervals, as in the diagram, they would produce a perfect right angle.

If you are given a right-angled triangle and asked to calculate the length of an unknown side, you can do this using Pythagoras' theorem if you know the lengths of the other two sides.

# Learning the rules

Pythagoras' theorem describes the relationship between the sides of a right-angled triangle.

The longest side – the side that does not touch the right angle – is known as the hypotenuse.

For this triangle, Pythagoras' theorem states that  $a^2 + b^2 = c^2$ .

In words this means that the square on the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the squares on the other two sides. Notice that the square of the hypotenuse is the subject of the equation. This should help you to remember where to place each number.

# Answers

a a² + b² = c²

$$
\begin{array}{l} 3 ^ {2} + 5 ^ {2} = x ^ {2} \\ 9 + 2 5 = x ^ {2} \\ \Rightarrow x ^ {2} = 3 4 \\ x = \sqrt {3 4} = 5. 8 3 0 9 \dots \\ \end{array}
$$

is approximately equal to  $5.8\mathrm{cm}$  (1 d.p.)

Round your final answer to 1 decimal place.

b a² + b² = c²

$$
\begin{array}{l} 8 ^ {2} + x ^ {2} = 1 7 ^ {2} \\ 6 4 + x ^ {2} = 2 8 9 \\ x ^ {2} = 2 8 9 - 6 4 \\ x ^ {2} = 2 2 5 \\ x = \sqrt {2 2 5} = 1 5 \mathrm {c m} \\ \end{array}
$$

You need to find a shorter side, so rearrange the formula to make  $x^{2}$  the subject.

# Checking for right-angled triangles

You can also use Pythagoras' theorem to determine if a triangle is right angled or not. Substitute the values of  $a$ ,  $b$  and  $c$  into the formula. If  $a^2 + b^2$  does not equal  $c^2$  then it is not a right-angled triangle.

# MATHEMATICAL CONNECTIONS

At the start of this section, you read that the Ancient Egyptians used knots in a rope to create exact right angles. You can now see that this works because the number of knots on each side of the triangle satisfies Pythagoras' theorem.

# WORKED EXAMPLE 2

Use Pythagoras' theorem to decide whether this triangle is right angled.

![](images/37441166cded40bd84ecf1f10c3764b150bf31d81b52d6ce8ea55d8142f6cb71.jpg)

# Answer

Check to see if Pythagoras' theorem is satisfied:

$$
c ^ {2} = a ^ {2} + b ^ {2}
$$

$$
a ^ {2} + b ^ {2} = 3. 1 ^ {2} + 4. 2 ^ {2} = 2 7. 2 5
$$

$$
c ^ {2} = 5. 3 ^ {2} = 2 8. 0 9 \neq 2 7. 2 5
$$

Pythagoras' theorem is not satisfied, so the triangle is not right angled.

# TIP

Notice here the theorem is written as  $c^2 = a^2 + b^2$ ; you will see it written like this or as  $a^2 + b^2 = c^2$ , but it means the same thing.

# TIP

The symbol  $\neq$  means 'does not equal'.

# Exercise 11.1

For all the questions in this exercise, give your final answer correct to 3 significant figures where appropriate.

# Applications of Pythagoras' theorem

You can use Pythagoras' theorem to solve real-life problems. In each case look carefully for right-angled triangles and draw them separately to show your working clearly.

# WORKED EXAMPLE 3

The diagram shows a bookcase that has fallen against a wall. The bookcase is  $1.85\mathrm{m}$  tall and it touches the wall at a point  $1.6\mathrm{m}$  above the ground. Calculate the distance of the foot of the bookcase from the wall. Give your answer to 2 decimal places.

Answer

Apply Pythagoras' theorem:

$$
\begin{array}{l} a ^ {2} + b ^ {2} = c ^ {2} \\ x ^ {2} + 1. 6 ^ {2} = 1. 8 5 ^ {2} \\ x ^ {2} = 1. 8 5 ^ {2} - 1. 6 ^ {2} \\ = 3. 4 2 2 5 - 2. 5 6 \\ = 0. 8 6 2 5 \\ x = \sqrt {0 . 8 6 2 5} = 0. 9 3 \mathrm {c m} (2 \mathrm {d}. \mathrm {p}.) \\ \end{array}
$$

Think about the triangle that is formed and draw it. Label each side and substitute the side lengths into the formula.

Answer

Draw a sketch showing the approximate position of points A and B.

Difference between the  $y$ -coordinates  $= 11 - 5 = 6$

Difference between the  $x$ -coordinates  $= 5 - 3 = 2$

$$
\begin{array}{l} A B ^ {2} = 6 ^ {2} + 2 ^ {2} \\ = 3 6 + 4 \\ = 4 0 \\ \end{array}

# 11.2 Understanding similar triangles

Two mathematically similar objects have exactly the same shape and proportions, but may be different in size.

When one shape is enlarged to produce the second shape, each part of the original will correspond to a particular part of the new shape. For triangles, corresponding sides join the same angles. The ratio that compares the measurements of two similar shapes is called the scale factor. The scale factor of lengths is the ratio that compares the length of corresponding sides.

All of the following are true for similar triangles:

![](images/15fc218814f1cc3fa8dfa94b42a8c733cd7a2075877538cf04fe1c716ac78118.jpg)

Corresponding angles are equal.

![](images/3dd124cc0b533456ece04a4549c3c9296adc05ae86d256652b82126b4799015e.jpg)

'Internal' ratios of sides are the same for both triangles. For example:

$$
\frac {A B}{B C} = \frac {D E}{E F}
$$

![](images/3ef60aa752bc65712b7492a13518164a2e61000f742fcf9ee79bb582011d393b.jpg)

Ratios of corresponding sides are equal:

$$
\frac {A B}{D E} = \frac {B C}{E F} = \frac {A C}{D F}
$$

If any of these things are true about two triangles, then all of them will be true for both triangles.

Gradients and triangles

You learnt about gradients of lines in Chapter 10.

1 Look back at Chapter 10 and use the ideas you learnt to plot the line with equation  $y = 3x - 1$ .  
2 Mark the points  $A(-1, - 4),B(1,2)$  and  $C(2,5)$  on the line.  
3 Draw a triangle on your graph, to show the gradient of the line AB and another to show the gradient BC. (Look back to Worked example 3 in Chapter 10 if you need a reminder.)

# INVESTIGATION CONTINUED

4 Each of your triangles has two sides that form a right angle. Divide the length of the vertical side by the length of the horizontal side. What is the relationship and how does this relate to the equation of the line?  
5 Draw more triangles to represent the gradient of the line and carry out the same calculations. What happens?  
6 For each triangle, measure the length of the hypotenuse and divide it by the shortest side length. What do you notice?  
7 Discuss with your partner how this shows that the triangles are all similar.

# WORKED EXAMPLE 5

Explain why the two triangles shown in the diagram are similar and work out the lengths of  $x$  and  $y$ .

![](images/2999d9a7fefe74d4202880e8832c61877d8d267d13d674eaabe7fcb8942aa59b.jpg)

# Answer

Angle ACB = 180° - 27° - 108° = 45°

Angle FED = 180° - 45° - 108° = 27°

Both triangles have exactly the same three angles, so they are similar.

Since the triangles are similar:  $\frac{DE}{AB} = \frac{EF}{BC} = \frac{DF}{AC}$

So:  $\frac{y}{8} = \frac{18}{6} = 3 \Rightarrow y = 24 \mathrm{~m}$

and:  $\frac{9}{x} = \frac{18}{6} = 3 \Rightarrow x = 3m$

# MATHEMATICAL CONNECTIONS

You learnt that the angle sum in a triangle is always  $180^{\circ}$  in Chapter 3.

# WORKED EXAMPLE 6

# WORKED EXAMPLE 6 CONTINUED

# Answer

Consider triangles ABG and AEF:

![](images/72f9aac55646aa8da6a41288b7c50b2cb7e955579e7fe5203ad43b106ae2b331.jpg)

![](images/6225052f785f8cc97ba4a26bab84fec4421649a5c79c75d1dffb20cb9f8dc848.jpg)

Angle BAG = FAE

Common to both triangles.

Angle AGB = AEF = 90°

Angle ABG = AFE

BG and FE are both vertical, hence parallel lines.

Angles correspond.

Therefore triangle ABG is similar to triangle AEF.

So:  $\frac{\text{height}}{0.9} = \frac{3}{1.2} \Rightarrow \text{height} = \frac{0.9 \times 3}{1.2} = 2.25 \text{m}$

# 11.3 Understanding similar shapes

In the previous section you worked with similar triangles, but any shapes can be similar. A shape is similar if the ratio of corresponding sides is equal and the corresponding angles are equal. Similar shapes are therefore identical in shape, but can be different sizes.

You can use the ratio of corresponding sides to find unknown sides of similar shapes just as you did with similar triangles.

# WORKED EXAMPLE 7

Ahmed has two rectangular flags. One measures  $1000\mathrm{mm}$  by  $500\mathrm{mm}$ , the other measures  $500\mathrm{mm}$  by  $350\mathrm{mm}$ . Are the flags similar in shape?

# Answer

$$
\frac {1 0 0 0}{5 0 0} = 2 \text {a n d} \frac {5 0 0}{3 5 0} = 1. 4 3
$$

Work out the ratio of corresponding sides.

$$
\frac {1 0 0 0}{5 0 0} \neq \frac {5 0 0}{3 5 0}
$$

The ratio of corresponding sides is not equal, therefore the shapes are not similar.

# WORKED EXAMPLE 8

Given that the two shapes in the diagram are mathematically similar, find the unknown length  $x$ .

![](images/7dd563985044f907fecb7925bd890737dfbb67863499af345a3f82b99ed9a49f.jpg)

# Answer

Using the ratios of corresponding sides:  $\frac{x}{12} = \frac{20}{8} = 2.5$

$$
\Rightarrow x = 1 2 \times 2. 5 = 3 0 m
$$

# INVESTIGATION

4 a All squares are similar to all other squares. Why is this the case?  
b Why are rectangles not always similar to all other rectangles?  
c Explain why circles are similar to all other circles.  
d You now know that circles are similar to all other circles and all squares are similar to all other squares. Are there any other shapes that behave like this?

# REFLECTION

There are two types of similar shape problems:

problems where you have to prove or decide whether a given set of shapes are similar  
problems where you have to calculate the missing angles and side lengths of similar shapes.

What do you need to do, or remember, to solve each type of problem?

# PEER ASSESSMENT

1 If you had to explain similar shapes to someone else, what would you tell them?  
Write a short statement or points (you can include simple diagrams) to explain similar shapes to another student.  
2 Exchange statements with a partner.

a Read each other's statements.  
b Tell your partner what you found helpful in their explanation.  
c Was there anything that was not helpful for you? Tell your partner why you found it unhelpful and suggest how they could improve it.

# Area of similar shapes

The two shapes in each pair below are similar:

Area = 47.61

If you look at the diagrams and the dimensions you can see that there is a relationship between the scale factor for corresponding sides and the area factor.

In similar figures where the ratio of corresponding sides is  $a:b$ , the ratio of areas is  $a^2:b^2$ .

In other words, scale factor of areas  $=$  (scale factor of lengths)².

# WORKED EXAMPLE 9

# Answer

Ratio of sides  $= 18:21 = 6:7$

Simplify the ratio before squaring it.

Ratio of areas  $= 6^{2}:7^{2}$

Square the ratio of lengths.

$$
= 3 6: 4 9
$$

# WORKED EXAMPLE 10

Similar rectangles ABCD and MNOP have lengths in the ratio 3:5. If rectangle ABCD has an area of  $900\mathrm{cm}^2$ , find the area of MNOP.

# Answer

Area MNOP  $= \frac{5^2}{3^2}$  Area ABCD

Square the ratio of lengths.

$$
\frac {\text {A r e a M N O P}}{9 0 0 \mathrm {c m} ^ {2}} = \frac {2 5}{9}
$$

Simplify and substitute in any known values.

Area MNOP = 25/9 × 900

Solve the equation.

$$
= 2 5 0 0 \mathrm {c m} ^ {2}
$$

The area of MNOP is  $2500\mathrm{cm}^2$

# WORKED EXAMPLE 11

$$
\frac {4 8}{1 0 8} = \frac {x ^ {2}}{3 2 4}
$$

$$
\frac {4 8}{1 0 8} \times 3 2 4 = x ^ {2}
$$

Simplify and solve.

$$
\begin{array}{l} x ^ {2} = 1 4 4 \\ x = 1 2 \\ \end{array}
$$

Diagonal AC is 12 cm long.

3 Mayumi is making a pattern using a regular pentagon. How will the area of the pentagon change if she:

a doubles the lengths of the sides?  
b trebles the lengths of the sides?  
c halves the lengths of the sides?

4 If the areas of two similar quadrilaterals are in the ratio 64:9, what is the ratio of matching sides?

# Similar solids

Three-dimensional shapes (solids) can also be similar.

Similar solids have the same shape, their corresponding angles are equal and all corresponding linear measures (edges, diameters, radii, heights and slant heights) are in the same ratio. As with similar two-dimensional shapes, the ratio that compares the measurements on the two shapes is called the scale factor.

Volume and surface area of similar solids

![](images/31497d5b56c1fe15f2e78ce777c63c0d41122da18cf9fc7d2408c7e3a84b5078.jpg)

The following table shows the side length and volume of each of these cubes.

![](images/0910923b8b8743a383284567c4683ff4c85d61c3c6a56689e116842aca1112e1.jpg)

Notice that when the side length is multiplied by 2 the volume is multiplied by  $2^{3} = 8$ .

Here, the scale factor of lengths is 2 and the scale factor of volumes is  $2^3$ .

Also, when the side length is multiplied by 5 the volume is multiplied by  $5^{3} = 125$ .

This time the scale factor of lengths is 5 and the scale factor of volumes is  $5^3$ .

In fact, this pattern is true in the general case:

Scale factor of volumes  $=$  (scale factor of lengths)

By considering the surface areas of the cubes you can also see that the rule about the scale factor of areas is still true:

Scale factor of areas  $=$  (scale factor of lengths)²

In summary, if two solids  $(A$  and  $B$  ) are similar:

the ratio of their volumes is equal to the cube of the ratio of corresponding lengths (edges, diameter, radii, heights and slant heights). In other words:  $\frac{\text{Volume } A}{\text{Volume } B} = \left(\frac{a}{b}\right)^3$  where  $a$  and  $b$  are corresponding lengths.  
the ratio of their surface areas is equal to the square of the ratio of corresponding linear measures. In other words:  $\frac{\text{Surface area } A}{\text{Surface area } B} = \left(\frac{a}{b}\right)^2$

The following worked examples show how you can use these scale factors.

# WORKED EXAMPLE 12

The cones shown in the diagram are mathematically similar. The smaller cone has a volume of  $40\mathrm{cm}^3$ . Find the volume of the larger cone.

![](images/dfb9d7d40ae6b19a5c0cf2431ae8dd1a5646bdbb869a137b123c4223b986eafb.jpg)

![](images/37e6097a87ee22ee84aebbe03c7af45f970c701bc3a61eb4b24db5bce167b0a5.jpg)

# Answer

Scale factor of lengths  $= \frac{12}{3} = 4$ $\Rightarrow$  Scale factor of volumes  $= 4^{3} = 64$

So the volume of the larger cone  $= 64 \times 40 = 2560 \, \text{cm}^3$ .

# TIP

Sometimes you are given the scale factor of areas or volumes instead of the scale factor of lengths. You can use square roots or cube roots to find the scale factor of lengths.

# TIP

Organised tables and lists are a useful problem-solving strategy. Include headings for rows and/or columns to make sure your table is easy to understand.

# TIP

A cone cut along a plane parallel to its base produces a smaller cone and a solid called a frustum.

# 11.4 Understanding congruence

Two shapes are congruent if they are the same shape and size.

# MATHEMATICAL CONNECTIONS

You will meet rotations and reflections in Chapter 19. When an object is reflected or rotated its shape and size remain unchanged. The resulting object is congruent to the original.

If two shapes are congruent then:

corresponding sides are equal in length.  
corresponding angles are equal  
the shapes have the same area.

Look at these pairs of congruent shapes. The corresponding sides and angles on each shape are marked using the same colours and symbols.

ABCD is congruent to EFGH  
MNOP is congruent to RQTS.

# APPLY YOUR SKILLS

6 Two people in different parts of a park take a walk. They both walk in a straight line for 1000 metres, then they turn  $110^{\circ}$  right and continue to walk straight for a while before making a  $120^{\circ}$  turn to right. From there they walk back in a straight line to their starting point. Is it possible that they walked in congruent triangular paths? Explain your answer.

# SUMMARY

# Do you know ...?

The longest side of a right-angled triangle is called the hypotenuse.

The square of the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the squares of the two shorter sides of the triangle.

Similar shapes have equal corresponding angles and the ratios of corresponding sides are equal.

If shapes are similar and the lengths of one shape are multiplied by a scale factor of  $n$ :

then the areas are multiplied by a scale factor of  $n^2$  
and the volumes are multiplied by a scale factor of  $n^3$

Congruent shapes are exactly equal to each other.

# Are you able to...?

Use Pythagoras' theorem to find an unknown side of a right-angled triangle.

use Pythagoras' theorem to solve real-life problems

decide whether or not two objects are mathematically similar

Use the fact that two objects are similar to calculate:

unknown lengths  
areas or volumes

recognise whether two shapes are congruent or not.

# SELF ASSESSMENT

Look critically at your worked solutions to the practice questions.

Answer these questions about your work.

Did you ...

choose the right methods and strategies?  
show how you arrived at your solutions?  
- give reasons for any statements you made?

# Chapter 12

# Averages and measures of spread

# IN THIS CHAPTER YOU WILL:

calculate the mean, median and mode of sets of data  
calculate and interpret the range as a measure of spread  
- interpret the meaning of average and range, and use them to compare sets of data  
- construct and use frequency distribution tables for grouped data  
calculate and work with quartiles  
- divide data into quartiles and calculate the interquartile range  
- identify the modal class from a grouped frequency distribution.

You can present statistical information in many different ways. If you choose a more complicated method, you increase the chance that another person will misinterpret the information. In the image on the previous page, several graphs are shown at once. Can you think when this might be helpful? When might it be unhelpful?

You do not always need to draw a diagram. Sometimes you present the information using a numerical summary. In this chapter you will explore different ways to present and compare data. Before you start, think about what statistical methods you already know.

# GETTING STARTED

Rohan records the number of hours, to the nearest half hour, he spends reading each week for seven weeks:

1.5 1.5 2 3.5 5 5.5 11.5

Roham says to Jessi, "On average, I read for 3.5 hours per week."

How has Raham worked out 3.5 hours?  
2 Do you agree with Rohan's claim?  
3 What information is lost when Roham makes his calculation?

Jess records how long she spends reading for the next seven weeks:

5.5 7 25 -3 7.5 9.5 1

Jess says to Roham, "On average, I read for 3 hours per week."

4 Why is Jess imcorrect?  
5 What can you do to give a better answer?

Rohan has made a mistake. His final value should be 14 and not 11.5.

6 What will happen to Raham's claim? Why?  
7 What other ways do you know to calculate averages? Are they useful here?

# 12.1 Different types of average

The shoe sizes of 19 students in a class are:

47667486811686356764

How would you describe the shape sizes in this class?

Sometimes you might want to represent a set of data with a single value. When you do this, you use an average value.

There are three main types of average used in statistics and you can use each of them to describe the shoe sizes for the class.

The is the value that occurs the most often. If you count how times each shoe size occurs in the class, you will find that the most common (most frequent) size is six, so in this example the mode is 6.

# KEY WORDS

grouped data

interquartile range

lowerquartile

作

median

modal class

mode

range

upper quartile

# T

There is more than one "average", so you should never refer to the average.

Always specify which average you are talking about: the mean, median or mode.

Another average is the mean. This is the value you get when you add up all the shoe sizes and divide your answer by the number of students:

$$
\frac {\text {t o t a l o f s h o e s i z e s}}{\text {n u m b e r o f s t u d e n t s}} = \frac {1 1 5}{1 9} = 6. 0 5 (2 \mathrm {d}. \mathrm {p}.)
$$

The mean value tells you that the shoe sizes appear to be distributed in some way around the value 6.05. It also gives you a good impression of the general 'size' of the data. Notice that the value of the mean, in this case, is not a possible shoe size.

The third average is called the median. The median is the middle value when data is arranged in ascending order. So, putting the shoe sizes in order from smallest to largest gives:

<table><tr><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>5</td><td>6</td><td>6</td><td>6</td><td>6</td><td>6</td><td>7</td><td>7</td><td>7</td><td>8</td><td>8</td><td>8</td><td>11</td></tr></table>

To find the middle number you can think of the first and last values as one pair and cross them off. Then continue crossing off pairs until you are left with a single value in the middle.

For these shoe sizes, the median value is 6.

Crossing off numbers from each end can be difficult if you have a lot of data. If you count from the left, you find that the median is the 10th value. Adding one to the number of students and dividing the result by two,  $\frac{(19 + 1)}{2}$ , also gives 10 as the median position.

You are left with a middle pair rather than a single value. If this happens then you need to find the mean of this middle pair:  $\frac{(6 + 6)}{2} = 6$ .

Notice that the position of the first value in this middle pair is  $\frac{20}{2} = 10$ . If you have an even number of data values, dividing the number by two will always give you the first value of the middle pair.

In summary:

Mode The value that appears in the list more than any other. There can be more than one mode but if there are no values that occur more often than any other then there is no mode.

Mean The value when you calculate total of all data number of values The mean may not be one of the actual data values.

Median 1 Arrange the data into ascending numerical order.

2 If the number of data is  $n$  and  $n$  is odd, find  $\frac{n + 1}{2}$ . This will give you the position of the median.

3 If  $n$  is even, then calculate  $\frac{n}{2}$ . This will give you the position of the first of the middle pair. Find the mean of this pair.

# TIP

If you take the mean of  $n$  items and multiply it by  $n$ , you get the total of all  $n$  values.

The mean is sometimes referred to as a measure of 'central tendency' of the data.

# LINK

Many people use averages in their work. Geographers use them to summarise numerical results for large populations, so they don't have to show every piece of numerical data they collect.

Medical scientists use means and medians to test whether or not a treatment makes a significant difference to the recovery of patients. They compare the average values for patients being tested with those of a 'control' group. The 'control' group is not given the same treatment, which means a fair comparison can take place.

Estate agents often list the median value of property sales in an area because the median price is not influenced by extreme values.

# Dealing with extreme values

Sometimes your set of data may contain values that are extreme in some way. For example, if you measure the speeds of cars passing a certain point you may find that some cars are moving unusually slowly or unusually quickly. It is also possible that you may have made a mistake and measured a speed incorrectly or just written down the wrong number!

Imagine these are the speeds (in kilometres per hour) of six cars passing a certain point in a five-minute period:

67.2 58.3 128.9 65.0 49.0 55.7

The value  $128.9\mathrm{km/h}$  seems much faster than any other car. How does this extreme value affect your averages?

You can check yourself that the mean of the above data including the extreme value is  $70.7\mathrm{km / h}$

This average is larger than all but one of the values and is not representative of the data. This means that in this situation the mean might be a poor choice of average. If you discover that the highest speed was a mistake, you can exclude it from the calculation and get the much more realistic value of  $59.0\mathrm{km / h}$ . (Try the calculation for yourself.)

If the extreme value is genuine and you cannot exclude it, then using the median is a better way to represent the main body of data. Start by writing the data in ascending order:

49.0 55.7 58.3 65.0 67.2 128.9

The median is the mean of 58.3 and 65.0. This is 61.7. Notice that if you remove the highest value, the median reduces to 58.3, so this doesn't change things very much.

There is no mode for these data.

# TIP

The number of data values is even, so the median is the mean of the 3rd and 4th data points.

# LINK

Most numerical quantities in physics are predictable, at least approximately, by using mathematical formulae to describe the situation. In these situations, extreme measurements that don't appear to follow a broad pattern need to be checked carefully. Any that are errors should be removed from the data. But remember, you can only remove the data if it really is incorrect.

# WORKED EXAMPLE 1

After six tests, Gad has a mean average score of  $48\%$ . He takes a seventh test and scores  $83\%$ .

What is Gadl's total score after six tests?  
b What is Gad's mean average score after seven tests?

# Answers

a Since mean= total of all data number of values

them, total of all data = mean × number of values

$$
\begin{array}{l} = 4 8 \times 6 \\ = 2 8 8 \\ \end{array}
$$

Total of all seven scores  $=$  total of first six plus seventh

$$
\begin{array}{l} = 2 8 8 + 8 3 \\ = 3 7 1 \\ \end{array}
$$

$$
m e a m = \frac {371}{7} = 53 \%
$$

# TIP

You could be asked to give reasons for choosing the mean or median as your average.

# TIP

This is good example of where you need to think before you conclude that Gad is a typical student (sconing  $53\%$ ). He may have had extra tuition and will get above  $80\%$  for all future tests.

# Exercise 12.1

1 For each of the following data sets calculate:

the mode

ii the medium

the mean.

a 12 2 5 6 9 3 12 13 10  
b59738258882  
2.1 3.8 2.4 7.6 8.2 3.4 5.6 8.2 4.5 2.1  
d 12 2 5 6 9 3 12 13 43

2 Look carefully at the data in parts (a) and (d) of question 1. What is different?

How did your mean, medium and mode change?

You can see from the contexts in some of these questions that averages can appear in just about any aspect of our lives, whether studying, reading the mews or investigating behavioural patterns. Can you think of any ways that you use averages im your everyday life?

# 12.2 Making comparisons using averages and ranges

Now you know how to find an average value to represent your data, you can compare two or more sets of data. However, just comparing the averages can sometimes be misleading.

It can also be helpful to know how consistent the data is. You do this by thinking about how scattered – or spread – the values are. A simple measure of spread is the range.

Range = largest value - smallest value

# TIP

Think about whether the player will choose an average that helps them claim they are a good player or an average that is a fair representation of their scores.

The larger the range, the more spread out the data is and the less consistent the values are with one another.

# WORKED EXAMPLE 2

Two groups of athletes want to compare their  $100\mathrm{m}$  sprint times. Each person runs once and records their time in seconds.

<table><tr><td>Team Pythagoras</td><td>14.3</td><td>16.6</td><td>14.3</td><td>17.9</td><td>14.1</td><td>15.7</td></tr><tr><td>Team Socrates</td><td>13.2</td><td>16.8</td><td>14.7</td><td>14.7</td><td>13.6</td><td>16.2</td></tr></table>

a Calculate the mean 100m time for each team.  
b Which is the smaller mean?  
c What does this tell you about the  $100\mathrm{m}$  times for Team Pythagoras compared to those for Team Socrates?  
d Calculate the range for each team.  
e What does this tell you about the performance of each team?

# Answers

a Team Pythagoras:

$$
\text {M e a n} = \frac {1 4 . 3 + 1 6 . 6 + 1 4 . 3 + 1 7 . 9 + 1 4 . 1 + 1 5 . 7}{6} = \frac {9 2 . 9}{6} = 1 5. 4 8 \text {s e c o n d s}
$$

$$
\text {M e a n} = \frac {1 3 . 2 + 1 6 . 8 + 1 4 . 7 + 1 4 . 7 + 1 3 . 6 + 1 6 . 2}{6} = \frac {8 9 . 2}{6} = 1 4. 8 7 \text {s e c o n d s}
$$

b Team Socrates have the smaller mean 100m time.  
c The smaller time means that Team Socrates are slightly faster as a team than Team Pythagoras.  
d Team Pythagoras' range  $= 17.9 - 14.1 = 3.8$  seconds Team Socrates' range  $= 16.8 - 13.2 = 3.6$  seconds  
e Team Socrates are slightly faster as a whole and they are slightly more consistent.

# INVESTIGATION

# Units for averages

You need to use the same units when comparing averages or ranges. There is no point in comparing one average or range measured in kilometres with another average or range measured in metres.

1.1 Calculate the mean and range of these lengths:

3.2m

2.8m

4.1m

1.6m

4.4m

# TIP

When comparing means or ranges, make sure that you refer to the original context of the question. If you are comparing waiting times in queues at different airports, for example, your conclusions should mention waiting times in queues at different airports!

# INVESTIGATION CONTINUED

2 Rewrite the lengths in centimetres. Calculate the mean and range of the new data. What do you notice?  
3 Try multiplying the original data by a fixed number and working out the mean and range again? What happens?  
4 Try to explain why this means you need to use the same units when comparing means or ranges.  
5 Investigate what happens if you add the same number to each value in your original data set. What happens to the mean? What about the range? Can you explain this?

# Exercise 12.2

1 Two friends, Ru and Oli, are picking berries. The mass (in kg) of each box they fill is recorded.

a For each person calculate:

i the mean mass of berries collected per box  
ii the range of masses.

b Who collected more berries per box?  
Who was more consistent when collecting the berries?

# SELF ASSESSMENT

1 Read through this activity that a class had to complete for homework. Think about how you would answer each question.

What mark do you think you would score out of 10 for this task? Why?

A developer monitors how many people visited a new website each hour for the first two days that the site went live.

These are the results arranged in order.

100, 105, 106, 106, 107, 107, 108, 110, 117, 118, 135, 137

145,148,148,148,153,155,157,159,162,171,171,179

1 Calculate:

a the mean, median and mode [4]  
b the range [1]

2 Company A owns the website and wants to sell advertising on it. What could they say about the number of visitors the site is receiving? [2]  
3 The developer compares the statistics for this website with those from a website run by Company B.

Company B

Mean number of visits per hour: 180

Median number of visits per hour: 140

Mode: 135 visits per hour

Range: 200

What could the developer say to compare the two sets of data? [3]

# SELF ASSESSMENT CONTINUED

2 Here is one student's answer to the homework activity.

What mark would you give this student out of 10? Why?

1 a Mean  $=$  sum of values/number of values  $= 8394 / 48$ $= 174.88$  visits per hour (2 dp.) Median  $= (179 + 183) / 2 = 181$  visits per hour Mode  $= 148$  b Range  $= 238 - 100 = 138$

2 The website consistently gets over 100 visits per hour with an average of 175 visits per hour.  
3 The mean number of visits to Company B's website is a bit higher than Company A's but the median number of visits to Company B is much lower. This suggests that the mean of Company B is affected by a few high values and the usual number of visits is actually lower. The data for Company B has quite a wide range and this suggests that the data is spread out and the number of visits per hour is less consistent than for Company A.

3 The work above is an example of a model answer.

a Did this student do anything differently to how you would have worked? What?  
b How can examples of good work like this one help you to improve your own work?

# 12.3 Calculating averages and ranges for frequency data

So far, you have calculated averages for quite small sets of data. When you have larger sets with more than 20 pieces of data, it is better to collect the data with the same value together and record it in a frequency distribution table.

# TIP

Sometimes a frequency distribution table is simply called a frequency distribution.

# Data shown in a frequency distribution table

If you throw a single dice 100 times, each of the six numbers will appear several times. You can record the number of times each number appears in a table:

<table><tr><td>Number showing on the upper face</td><td>1</td><td>2</td><td>3</td><td>4</td><td>5</td><td>6</td></tr><tr><td>Frequency</td><td>16</td><td>13</td><td>14</td><td>17</td><td>19</td><td>21</td></tr></table>

# Mean

To calculate the mean, you first need to find the total of all 100 throws. There are sixteen 1s, which give a subtotal of  $1 \times 16 = 16$ , thirteen 2s giving a subtotal of  $13 \times 2 = 26$  and so on. You can extend your table to show this:

<table><tr><td>Number showing on the upper face</td><td>Frequency</td><td>Frequency x number on the upper face</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>16</td><td>1 x 16 = 16</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>13</td><td>2 x 13 = 26</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>14</td><td>3 x 14 = 42</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>17</td><td>17 x 4 = 68</td></tr><tr><td>5</td><td>19</td><td>19 x 5 = 95</td></tr><tr><td>6</td><td>21</td><td>21 x 6 = 126</td></tr></table>

The total of all 100 throws is the sum of all values in this third column:

$$
\begin{array}{l} \text {T o t a l s c o r e} = 1 6 + 2 6 + 4 2 + 6 8 + 9 5 + 1 2 6 \\ = 3 7 3 \\ \end{array}
$$

So the mean score per throw  $= \frac{\text{total score}}{\text{total number of throws}} = \frac{373}{100} = 3.73$ .

# MATHEMATICAL CONNECTIONS

In Chapter 8 you studied the idea of 'experimental probability'. Notice that you also recorded data in frequency tables, so that you could estimate probabilities of different events.

# Median

There are 100 throws, which is an even number, so the median will be the mean of a middle pair. The first of this middle pair is in position  $\frac{100}{2} = 50$ .

The values are all in order in the table. The first 16 are 1s, the next 13 are 2s and so on. If you add the first three frequencies, you get  $16 + 13 + 14 = 43$ . This means that the first 43 values are 1, 2 or 3. The next 17 values are all 4s, so the 50th and 51st values are both 4. The mean of two 4s is 4, so this is the median.

![](images/8a630d264a6df9d5eb49f655d153b62f8a4ae82c174d804d16b35f980c03da4f.jpg)

# TIP

You can add columns to a table given to you to help organise your calculations. In this case you need to swap the rows and columns to make it easier to use.

# Mode

For the mode you simply need to find the value that has the highest frequency. The number 6 occurs most often (21 times), so 6 is the mode.

# Range

The highest and lowest values are known, so the range is  $6 - 1 = 5$

# Data organised into a stem-and-leaf diagram

You can determine averages and the range from stem-and-leaf diagrams.

# Mean

A stem-and-leaf diagram shows all the data values, so you find the mean by adding all the values and dividing them by the number of values in the same way you find the mean of any data set.

# Median

You can use an ordered stem-and-leaf diagram to find the median. In an ordered stem-and-leaf diagram the leaves for each stem are arranged in order from smallest to greatest.

# Mode

An ordered stem-and-leaf diagram allows you see which values are repeated in each row. You can compare these to find the mode.

# Range

You can use the first and last value in an ordered stem-and-leaf diagram to find the range.

<table><tr><td>Stem</td><td>Leaf</td><td>Key</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>2 5 5 6 6 6 6</td><td rowspan="3">0 | 2 represents 2 customers</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>1 3 3 5 5 6 7 7</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>1</td></tr></table>

# MATHEMATICAL CONNECTIONS

You learnt about stem-and-leaf diagrams in Chapter 4.

# WORKED EXAMPLE 3 CONTINUED

# Answers

a The lowest number is 2 and the highest number is 21. The range is  $21 - 2 = 19$  customers.  
b 6 is the value that appears most often.  
c There are 16 pieces of data, so the median is the mean of the 8th and 9th values:

$$
\frac {(1 1 + 1 3)}{2} = \frac {2 4}{2} = 1 2
$$

d To calculate the total number of customers, find the sum of all the values. Find the total for each row and combine them to find the overall total:

Row 1:  $2 + 5 + 5 + 6 + 6 + 6 + 6 = 36$   
Row 2:  $11 + 13 + 13 + 15 + 15 + 16 + 17 + 17 = 117$   
Row 3: 21  
 $36 + 117 + 21 = 174$  customers in total

e Mean  $= \frac{\text{sum of data values}}{\text{number of data values}} = \frac{174}{16} = 10.875$  customers per half hour

# In summary:

Mode The value that has the highest frequency is the mode. If more than one value has the same highest frequency, then there is no single mode.  
Mean total of all data sum of frequency  $\times$  value number of values total frequency

(Remember to extend the table so that you can fill in a column for calculating frequency  $\times$  value in each case.)

- Median - If the number of data values is  $n$  and  $n$  is odd, then  $\frac{n + 1}{2}$  gives the position of the median. Add the frequencies until you reach the median position. The value in this position is the median.  
If  $n$  is even, then  $\frac{n}{2}$  gives the position of the first of the middle pair. Add the frequencies until you reach this position and then find the mean of the pair.

# Exercise 12.3

# REFLECTION

What have you learnt about using averages in real-life situations in this section? Has what you know about averages changed in any way? If so, how?

# 12.4 Estimating the mean and finding the modal class for grouped data

# MATHEMATICAL CONNECTIONS

You learnt about discrete, continuous and grouped data in Chapter 4 and you used inequality notation to define the groups. You may find it helpful to review that work before continuing.

# LINK

Real-world data can involve thousands of data points, so it is clear that grouping data, rather than recording a list of exact values is sensible.

When a government carries out a national census to collect numerical data about the population, the questions asked often involve ranges of ages, salaries and so on. It is not practical to record the individual details for every person, but a simple frequency or percentage for each class gives more than enough information.

When data is grouped in a frequency table you do not have the actual data points, so you have to work with the classes to estimate the mean and mode.

The following worked example shows how a grouped frequency table is used to find the estimated mean and the modal class

# WORKED EXAMPLE 4

The heights of 100 children were measured in cm and the results recorded in a table.

<table><tr><td>Height in cm (h)</td><td>Frequency (f)</td></tr><tr><td>120 &lt; h ≤ 130</td><td>12</td></tr><tr><td>130 &lt; h ≤ 140</td><td>16</td></tr><tr><td>140 &lt; h ≤ 150</td><td>38</td></tr><tr><td>150 &lt; h ≤ 160</td><td>24</td></tr><tr><td>160 &lt; h ≤ 170</td><td>10</td></tr></table>

Find:

a an estimate for the mean height of the children  
b the modal class.

# Answers

a You don't know any of the children's heights exactly, so you use the midpoint of each class as the best estimate of the height of each child in that class. For example, the 12 children in the  $120 \leq h < 130$  class have heights between  $120\mathrm{cm}$  and  $130\mathrm{cm}$ , but that is all that you know.

Halfway between  $120\mathrm{cm}$  and  $130\mathrm{cm}$  is  $\frac{(120 + 130)}{2} = 125\mathrm{cm}$ .

A good estimate of the total height of the 12 children in this class is  $12 \times 125$  (frequency  $\times$  midpoint).

Extend your table to include midpoints and totals for each class:

<table><tr><td>Height in cm (h)</td><td>Frequency (f)</td><td>Midpoint (x)</td><td>Frequency x midpoint (fx)</td></tr><tr><td>120 &lt; h ≤ 130</td><td>12</td><td>125</td><td>12 × 125 = 1500</td></tr><tr><td>130 &lt; h ≤ 140</td><td>16</td><td>135</td><td>16 × 135 = 2160</td></tr><tr><td>140 &lt; h ≤ 150</td><td>38</td><td>145</td><td>38 × 145 = 5510</td></tr><tr><td>150 &lt; h ≤ 160</td><td>24</td><td>155</td><td>24 × 155 = 3720</td></tr><tr><td>160 &lt; h ≤ 170</td><td>10</td><td>165</td><td>10 × 165 = 1650</td></tr></table>

An estimate for the mean height of the children is:

$$
\frac {1 5 0 0 + 2 1 6 0 + 5 5 1 0 + 3 7 2 0 + 1 6 5 0}{1 2 + 1 6 + 3 8 + 2 4 + 1 0} = \frac {1 4 5 4 0}{1 0 0} = 1 4 5. 4 \mathrm {c m}
$$

b The class with the highest frequency is the modal class. In this case it is the class:  $140 < h \leqslant 150$ .

# MATHEMATICAL CONNECTIONS

Histograms provide a clear way of representing grouped data in graphical form. You will study these in Chapter 20.

# TIP

If a question asks you to explain why your calculations only give an estimate, remember that you don't have the exact data, only frequencies and classes.

# Exercise 12.4

a Find an estimate for the mean height of the sculptures.

Calculate an estimate for the mean temperature of the test tubes.

# TIP

The symbol  $\Sigma$  is the Greek letter capital 'sigma'. It is used to mean 'sum'. So,  $\Sigma f$  simply means 'the sum of all the frequencies'.

4 Two athletics teams - the Hawks and the Eagles - are about to compete in a race. The masses of the team members are shown in the table below.

# LINK

Psychology relies heavily on statistics and if you do a psychology course you often need to complete a statistics module. Measurements (data) collected by psychologists include test scores (marks) as well as general properties in different population samples. Usually, a large amount of data is collected, so using estimated means and modal classes allow psychologists to develop ideas of what is usual and what is unusual and draw generalised conclusions from the data sets.

# TIP

In this question ages are rounded to the nearest year. Someone who is 30 and a half is placed in the 31-35 class, because their age rounds up to 31 to the nearest year. In real life this person would say they are still 30.

# 12.5 Quartiles

Quartiles are used to divide a data set into four groups. Quartiles are indicated by the symbols  $Q_{1}$ ,  $Q_{2}$  and  $Q_{3}$ .

You can use the following rules to estimate the positions of each quartile within a set of  $n$  items of ordered data:

$$
\begin{array}{l} Q _ {1} = \text {l o w e r q u a r t i l e} = \text {v a l u e i n p o s i t i o n} \frac {1}{4} (n + 1) \\ Q _ {2} = \text {m e d i a n} \text {(a s c a l c u l a t e d e a l i e r i n t h e c h a r d e r)} \\ Q _ {3} = \text {u p p e r q u a r t i l e} = \text {v a l u e i n p o s i t i o n} \frac {3}{4} (n + 1) \\ \end{array}
$$

If the position does not turn out to be a whole number, find the mean of the pair of numbers on either side. For example, if the position of the lower quartile turns out to be 5.25, then you find the mean of the 5th and 6th values.

# Interquartile range

As with the range, the interquartile range gives a measure of how spread out or consistent the data is. The main difference is that the interquartile range (IQR) avoids using extreme data by finding the difference between the lower and upper quartiles. You are, effectively, measuring the spread of the central  $50\%$  of the data.

$$
I Q R = Q _ {3} - Q _ {1}
$$

If one set of data has a smaller IQR than another set, then the first set is more consistent and less spread out. This can be a useful comparison tool.

# WORKED EXAMPLE 5

For each set of data calculate the median, upper quartile, lower quartile and the interquartile range.

a 13 12 8 6 11 14 8 5 1 10 16 12  
b 14 10 8 19 15 14 9

# Answer

a First sort the data into ascending order:

1568810111212131416

There are an even number of items (12). So, to find the median, find the mean of the middle pair. The first of the pair is in position  $\frac{12}{2} = 6$ , so the median is  $\frac{(10 + 11)}{2} = 10.5$ .

Calculate the position of the quartiles:

$$
\frac {1}{4} (1 2 + 1) = 3. 2 5 \text {a n d} \frac {3}{4} (1 2 + 1) = 9. 7 5
$$

These are not whole numbers, so the lower quartile is the mean of the 3rd and 4th values, and the upper quartile is the mean of the 9th and 10th values.

$$
Q _ {1} \frac {(6 + 8)}{2} = 7 \text {a n d} Q _ {3} = \frac {(1 2 + 1 3)}{2} = 1 2. 5
$$

Then you know that the IQR = 12.5 - 7 = 5.5.

b The ordered data is:

891014141519

There is an odd number of data values, so the median is in position  $\frac{(7 + 1)}{2} = 4$ . The median is 14.

# MATHEMATICAL CONNECTIONS

In Chapter 20 you will learn about cumulative frequency graphs. These allow you to calculate estimates for the median and quartiles when there are too many data points to put into order, or when you have grouped data.

# WORKED EXAMPLE 5 CONTINUED

There are seven items, so the positions of the quartiles are:  $\frac{1}{4} (7 + 1) = 2$  and  $\frac{3}{4} (7 + 1) = 6$ .

These are whole numbers so the lower quartile is in position two and the upper quartile is in position six.

So  $Q_{1} = 9$  and  $Q_{3} = 15$ .

IQR=15-9=6

# WORKED EXAMPLE 6

Two companies sell sunflower seeds. In one year, seeds from Allbright produce flowers with a median height of 98 cm and IQR of 13 cm. In the same year seeds from Barstows produce flowers with a median height of 95 cm and IQR of 4 cm. Which seeds would you buy if you wanted to enter a competition for growing the tallest sunflower and why?

# Answer

I would buy Barstows' seeds. Although Allbright sunflowers seem taller (with a higher median) they are less consistent. So, there is a chance of a very big sunflower, but there is also a good chance of a small sunflower. Barstows' sunflowers are a bit shorter, but are more consistent in their heights so you are more likely to get flowers around the height of 95 cm.

a Determine the median for each group.  
b Find the range for:

i vegetarians

ii non-vegetarians.

c Determine the interquartile range for:

i vegetarians

ii non-vegetarians.

d LDL levels of  $<  130$  are desirable, levels of 130-160 are considered borderline high and levels  $>160$  are considered high risk. Using these figures, comment on what the distribution on the stem-and-leaf diagram suggests.

# Answer

a The data is already ordered and there are 35 values in each set.

$$
\frac {1}{2} (3 5 + 1) = 1 8, \text {s o t h e m e d i a n i s t h e 1 8 t h v a l u e}.
$$

Median  $= 128$  for vegetarians

ii Median  $= 164$  for non-vegetarians

b i Range  $= 173 - 90 = 83$  for vegetarians

ii Range  $= 215 - 112 = 103$  for non-vegetarians

c Determine the position of  $Q_{1}$  and  $Q_{3}$

The lower quartile  $= \frac{1}{4} (35 + 1) = 9$ th value

The upper quartile  $= \frac{3}{4} (35 + 1) = 27$ th value

IQR = Q3 - Q1 = 142 - 116 = 26 for vegetarians

ii  $IQR = Q_{3} - Q_{1} = 180 - 145 = 35$  for non-vegetarians.

d For vegetarians the data is skewed toward the lower levels on the stem- and-leaf diagram. More than half of the values are in the desirable range, with only three in the high-risk range. For non-vegetarians, the data is more spread out. Only three values are in the desirable range, 12 are borderline high and 20 are in the high-risk category.

This might suggest that non-vegetarians have higher levels of bad cholesterol in general. However, without considering other risk factors or medical history, you cannot say this for certain from one set of data.

# SUMMARY

# Do you know ...?

Averages - the mode, median and mean - are used to summarise a collection of data.

Discrete data can be listed or arranged in a frequency distribution.

Continuous data can be listed or arranged into groups.

The mean is affected by extreme data.

The median is less affected by extreme data.

The lower quartile  $(Q_{1})$  lies  $25\%$  of the way through the data.

The upper quartile  $(Q_{1})$  lies  $75\%$  of the way through the data.

The interquartile range  $(\mathrm{IQR} = \mathrm{Q}_3 - \mathrm{Q}_1)$  gives a measure of how spread out or consistent the central  $50\%$  of the data is.

The range is the difference between the largest and smallest values and also measures spread, but it is affected by extreme values and is used less often than the interquartile range.

# Unit 3 Project

# Litov's mean value theorem

Start with any two numbers, for example 8 and 2.

Generate a sequence where the next number is the mean of the previous two numbers.

So the next number is half of  $(8 + 2)$  , and the sequence continues: 8, 2, 5.  
The next number is half of  $(2 + 5)$  , and the sequence continues: 8, 2, 5, 3.5.

What would happen if you continued this process indefinitely?

Choose a few pairs of starting numbers and repeat the process.

Each time, your sequence should get closer and closer to a value which we call the limit.

Can you find a relationship between your starting numbers and the limit of the sequence they generate?

Can you explain why this happens?

# Investigate starting with three numbers

Generate a sequence where the next number is the mean of the previous three numbers.

- Check you agree that if we start with 4, 1, 10, the next number is 5, and the number after that is  $\frac{16}{3}$ .

What would happen if you continued this process indefinitely?

Choose some more sets of three starting numbers.

Can you find a relationship between your starting numbers and the limit of the sequence they generate?

Can you explain why this happens?

# GO FURTHER

Explore what happens when you have  $n$  starting numbers and you generate a sequence where the next number is the mean of the last  $n$  numbers.

# Understanding measurement

# IN THIS CHAPTER YOU WILL:

learn how to convert between units in the metric system  
- solve problems involving time calculations and timetables  
use a calculator to work out time calculations  
find lower and upper bounds of numbers that are written to a given level of accuracy  
- solve problems involving upper and lower bounds  
- use conversion graphs to change units from one measuring system to another  
use exchange rates to convert currencies.

Meteorologists need to think about a very large number of measurements when predicting the path of a weather system such as a hurricane. These can include air temperature, sea temperature, air pressure and the area of land covered by the path of the hurricane. What other measurements might be useful?

All these different measurements mean that lots of small errors can combine to give a large total error, so there is always some uncertainty when trying to predict the likely path and power of a weather system.

# GETTING STARTED

Units are often grouped together or subdivided into different units. If you want to convert between units you usually have to multiply or divide by powers of 10. For example, think about the relationship between metres, centimetres and millimetres:

1 Draw a similar diagram for kilograms, grams and milligrams.  
2 Find out what the prefixes kilo-, milli-, centi- mean.  
3 Think about some other units and how to convert between them. Consider units of distance, mass and time. Draw some diagrams to represent the conversations.

# 13.1 Understanding units

Vishal has a  $1\mathrm{m} \times 1\mathrm{m} \times 1\mathrm{m}$  box and has collected a large number of  $1\mathrm{cm} \times 1\mathrm{cm} \times 1\mathrm{cm}$  building blocks. He decides to stack all the cubes neatly into the box.

Try to imagine a  $1\mathrm{m}\times 1\mathrm{m}\times 1\mathrm{m}$  box.

The length of each side is  $1\mathrm{m} = 100\mathrm{cm}$ . The total number of  $1\mathrm{cm} \times 1\mathrm{cm} \times 1\mathrm{cm}$  cubes that fit inside is  $100 \times 100 \times 100 = 1000000$ .

This means that one cubic metre is equivalent to one million cubic centimetres! So, you can see that if you change the units you measure with, the number of units can be very different.

Almost all work in physics involves studying the relationships between different quantities we can measure. Physicists need to understand how units relate to one another. The way in which we express masses, speeds, temperatures and a vast array of other quantities can depend on the units used.

Centimetres and metres are examples of metric measurements. The table below shows some important conversions.

The International System of Units (known as S.I. units, from the French name Système International) is the most commonly accepted and used system for units in science. It was developed over many years, starting around 1742 when the Swedish astronomer Anders Celsius devised a standard temperature scale. You can look up the units included in this system and see how many you recognise.

# TIP

Capacity measures what something can contain, not how much it does contain. For example, a jug with a capacity of 1 litre might be half full and only contain 500 ml. In this case, you can say the volume of liquid in the jug is 500 ml.

# WORKED EXAMPLE 1

Express:

a 5km in cm

b 3.2cm in m

2000000cm² in m².

# Answers

a  $1\mathrm{km} = 1000\mathrm{m} = 1000\times 100\mathrm{cm} = 100000\mathrm{cm}$

So.  $5\mathrm{km} = 5\times 100000\mathrm{cm} = 500000\mathrm{cm}$

b  $100\mathrm{cm} = 1\mathrm{m}$  so  $1\mathrm{cm} = 0.01\mathrm{m}$

So,  $3.2\mathrm{cm} = 3.2 \times 0.01 = 0.032\mathrm{m}$

$1\mathrm{m}^2 = 100\mathrm{cm}\times 100\mathrm{cm} = 10000\mathrm{cm}^2$

So,  $2000000\mathrm{cm}^2 = \frac{2000000}{10000} = 200\mathrm{m}^2$

11 a You may have seen the use of 'mega' and 'micro' in science. In Greek, 'mega' means 'large' and 'micro' means 'small'. Scientists use the word 'mega' to talk about 'millions' and 'micro' to talk about 'millionths'. Not everyone uses these words in quite the same way. Try to find out what 'mega' usually means in computing.

b Try to find out about some more prefixes, like 'giga', 'terra', 'peta'. What others can you find?

It is important to have a good understanding of what different units mean. If the weather forecast on a website tells you the windspeed is  $11\mathrm{m / s}$  this might seem low, but it is in fact close to  $40\mathrm{km / h}$ . Getting this wrong might be a big mistake if you are climbing a mountain or driving a large truck!

Sara left home at 2.15 p.m. and returned at 3.50 p.m. How long was Sara away from home?

# Answer

From 2.15p.m. to 3.00p.m. is 45 minutes Start by counting on to the next  
From 3.00p.m. to 3.50p.m. is 50 minutes whole hour.

# Babylonian mathematics

It may seem strange to have 60 as the number for converting units of time. This choice seems to have been made by the ancient Babylonians. They used 60 as their 'base' number, in the same way that use 10 for our most common number system. We call our number system a decimal system. The Babylonian system was a sexagesimal system!

1 Find all of the factors of the number 60.  
2 Our decimal system is useful because we have 10 fingers and thumbs on our hands, divided into 2 lots of 5. Look at the factors of 60 and carry out some research to try to find out why the Babylonians might have chosen a sexagesimal system.  
3 The Babylonians also seem to be the reason why we have 360 degrees in a full circle. What unit of time do you know that is divided into just over 360 units? How does this relate to a full turn of a circle?

The next example shows you how to calculate the duration of an event.

# WORKED EXAMPLE 3

A train leaves at 05:35 and arrives at 18:20. How long is the journey?

# Answers

You cannot simply calculate 18:20 - 05:35 because this does not take into account that time is not decimal. You can use the degrees, minutes and seconds function of a calculator to work with time. Look for the DMS key to do this. To work out 18:20 - 05:35

Enter 18

The display will show  $12^{\circ}45'00''$

Write this as 12 hours and 45 minutes.

# TIP

Calculators work differently, so learn how the time functions work on your calculator. Try to use your calculator to get the same answers as in the worked examples. You can also use this to check your answers in any exercises.

The methods you have seen in the examples so far are best used when you are dealing with time within the same day. But what happens when the time difference goes from one day to another day?

# WORKED EXAMPLE 4

How much time passes from 19:35 on Monday to 03:55 on Tuesday?

# Answer

19:35 to 24:00 is one part and 00:00 to 03:55 the next day is the other part.

A good way to start this problem is to divide the time into parts.

# Part one:

19:35 to 20:00 is 25 minutes  
20:00 to 24:00 is 4 hours  
So, 19:35 to 24:00 is 4 h 25 min

Work out how much time passes to reach midnight.

# Part two:

0:00 to 03:55 is 3 h 55 min

03:55 is 3 hours and 55 minutes past midnight.

4h 25min + 3h 55min = 7h 80min = 8h 20min

Add the result of the two parts together.

The total time is 8 hours and 20 minutes.

80 minutes = 1 hour 20 minutes

# TIP

When dealing with time problems, consider what is being asked and what operations you need to do to answer the question. Decide whether it makes sense to convert times to 24-hour format or not.

# Reading timetables

Most travel timetables are given as tables with columns representing journeys. The 24-hour system is used to give the times.

Here is an example:

<table><tr><td></td><td>SX</td><td>D</td><td>D</td><td>D</td><td>MO</td><td>D</td><td>SX</td></tr><tr><td>Anytown</td><td>06:30</td><td>07:45</td><td>12:00</td><td>16:30</td><td>17:15</td><td>18:00</td><td>20:30</td></tr><tr><td>Beecity</td><td>06:50</td><td>08:05</td><td>12:25</td><td>16:50</td><td>17:35</td><td>18:25</td><td>20:50</td></tr><tr><td>Ceeville</td><td>07:25</td><td>08:40</td><td>13:15</td><td>17:25</td><td>18:15</td><td>19:05</td><td>21:25</td></tr></table>

D - daily including Sundays, SX - daily except Saturdays, MO - Mondays only

Make sure you can see that each column represents a journey. For example, the first column shows a bus leaving at 06:30 every day except Saturday (six times per week). It arrives at the next town. Beecity, at 06:50 and then goes on to Ceeville, where it arrives at 07:25.

# 13.3 Limits of accuracy - upper and lower bounds

Measurements are always given to a certain level of accuracy. The limits of accuracy of any measurement depends on the instruments used to measure it, but even with very accurate scientific measuring devices, quantities cannot be measured exactly because they are continuous values.

![](images/074111bf56f678eed1209940f8248ff2b85805c8199e0e7944ec04024b34fa27.jpg)

# MATHEMATICAL CONNECTIONS

You learnt to round numbers in Chapter 1. Make sure that you remember how rounding works before continuing with this section.

The way we round numbers means that all measurements have to be between certain limits. These limits depend on the level of accuracy that was used to round the measurement.

The smallest value a measurement can take is called the lower bound. The greatest value it can take is called the upper bound. The difference between the upper and lower bounds is called the error interval - a measurement can fall anywhere within this interval.

Read through the next example to see how these bounds apply in real life.

Raeman operates a crane at a building site. The manufacturer states that the crane can safely lift a maximum of 6.2 tonnes. Raeman needs to move some 1.2 tonne blocks, where the mass of each block is given to 1 decimal place. He starts by calculating how many 1.2 tonne blocks make 6.2 tonnes in total.  $\frac{6.2}{1.2} = 5.17$  blocks, so Raeman decides he can safely lift 5 blocks.

But, the mass of the blocks has been rounded to 1 decimal place. What if the blocks all weigh 1.245 tonnes? They all round to 1.2 tonnes to 1 decimal place, but the total mass of 5 blocks is now:

This is more than the crane can lift safely.

The Hubble Space Telescope, launched into space in 1990, was originally made with a  $1\mathrm{mm}$  error in the shape of the lens. This caused many of the images to be blurred and a repair had to be made in 1993. Even a small error can completely ruin scientific instruments that rely on precise measurement.

# Finding the greatest and least possible values of a rounded measurement

In the crane example 1.2 tonnes is rounded to 1 decimal place. It can be useful to work out the greatest and least possible values of the actual measurement.

If you place 1.2 on a number line, you can see much more clearly what the range of possible values are:

![](images/14873363802bcc755a31fd6e8a3abbbe80f7b3113765e44801ab5a8b94208d0d.jpg)

At the upper end, the range of possible values stops at 1.25. If you round 1.25 to 1 decimal place you get 1.3. Although 1.25 does not round to 1.2 (to 1 decimal place).

it is still used as the upper value. However, you should understand that the actual value can be anything up to but not including 1.25. The largest possible value is called the upper bound. Similarly, the lowest possible value is called the lower bound.

# TIP

To find the limits think about what 1 decimal place means. One decimal place is 0.1. If you divide 0.1 by 2 you get 0.05. Add 0.05 to find the upper limit and subtract 0.05 to find the lower limit. Write the boundaries as an inequality.

$$
1. 1 5 <   \frac {+ 0 . 0 5}{1 . 2} \frac {+ 0 . 0 5}{1 . 2} <   1. 2 5
$$

If  $m$  represents the mass (in tonnes) of the block, then you can express the error interval as:

$$
1. 1 5 \leqslant m <   1. 2 5
$$

This is called inequality notation and it shows that the true value of  $m$  lies between 1.15 (including 1.15) and 1.25 (not including 1.25).

d  $\frac{a}{b}$

# Answers

First, find the upper and lower bounds of  $a$  and  $b$ :

$$
3. 5 5 \leqslant a <   3. 6 5 \text {a n d} 1 3. 5 \leqslant b <   1 4. 5
$$

a Upper bound for  $(a + b) =$  upper bound of  $a +$  upper bound of  $b$

$$
\begin{array}{l} = 3. 6 5 + 1 4. 5 \\ = 1 8. 1 5 \\ \end{array}
$$

Lower bound for  $(a + b) =$  lower bound for  $a +$  lower bound for  $b$

$$
\begin{array}{l} = 3. 5 5 + 1 3. 5 \\ = 1 7. 0 5 \\ \end{array}
$$

You can write this as:  $17.05 \leqslant (a + b) < 18.15$

b Upper bound for ab = upper bound for a  $\times$  upper bound for b

$$
\begin{array}{l} = 3. 6 5 \times 1 4. 5 \\ = 5 2. 9 2 5 \\ \end{array}
$$

Lower bound for  $ab =$  lower bound of  $a \times$  lower bound of  $b$

$$
\begin{array}{l} = 3. 5 5 \times 1 3. 5 \\ = 4 7. 9 2 5 \\ \end{array}
$$

You can write this as:  $47.925 \leqslant ab < 52.925$

c Think carefully about  $b - a$  .To find the upper bound you need to subtract the smallest possible number from the largest possible number. So:

Upper bound for  $(b - a) =$  upper bound for  $b -$  lower bound for a

$$
\begin{array}{l} = 1 4. 5 - 3. 5 5 \\ = 1 0. 9 5 \\ \end{array}
$$

For the lower bound, subtract the largest possible number from the smallest possible number:

Lower bound for  $(b - a) =$  lower bound for  $b$  - upper bound for a

$$
\begin{array}{l} = 1 3. 5 - 3. 6 5 \\ = 9. 8 5 \\ \end{array}
$$

You can write this as:  $9.85 \leqslant (b - a) < 10.95$

d To find the upper bound of  $\frac{a}{b}$  you need to divide the largest possible value of  $a$  by the smallest possible value of  $b$ :

$$
\text {U p p e r b o u n d} = \frac {\text {u p p e r b o u n d f o r a}}{\text {l o w e r b o u n d f o r b}} = \frac {3 . 6 5}{1 3 . 5} = 0. 2 7 0 3 \dots = 0. 2 7 0 (3 \text {s . f .})
$$

$$
\text {L o w e r b o u n d} = \frac {\text {l o w e r b o u n d f o r} a}{\text {u p p e r b o u n d f o r} b} = \frac {3 . 5 5}{1 4 . 5} = 0. 2 4 4 8 \dots = 0. 2 4 5 (3 \text {s . f .})
$$

You can write this as:  $0.245 \leq \frac{a}{b} < 0.270$

# WORKED EXAMPLE 8 CONTINUED

e Upper bound of  $= \frac{a + b}{a} = \frac{\text{upper bound for } a + b}{\text{lower bound for } a} = \frac{18.15}{3.55}$

$$
= 5. 1 1 2 6 \dots = 5. 1 1 (3 \mathrm {s}. \mathrm {f})
$$

Lower bound of  $= \frac{a + b}{a} = \frac{\text{lower bound for } a + b}{\text{upper bound for } a} = \frac{17.05}{3.65}$

$$
= 4. 6 7 1 2 \dots = 4. 6 7 (3 \mathrm {s}. \mathrm {f}.)
$$

You can write this as:  $4.67 \leq \frac{a + b}{a} < 5.11$

Measurements are not ever exact.

Any measurement will fall between limits called the upper and lower bound.

You can write a measurement as an inequality that shows the error interval (what the measurement could be).

When you use approximate measurements in calculations you combine small errors to get a bigger error and the answer will be less accurate than if you only round the final answer.

# 13.4 Conversion graphs

So far in this chapter, you have seen that it is possible to convert between different units in the metric system. Another measuring system is the imperial system. Sometimes you might need to convert a measurement from one system to the other. Similarly, different countries use different currencies, for example dollars, yen, pounds and euros. When trading, it is important to accurately convert between currencies.

You can use conversion graphs when you need to convert from one measurement to another, for example from miles (imperial) to kilometres (metric) or from dollars to yen.

Eight kilometres is approximately equal to five miles.  
If you travel no distance in kilometres then you also travel no distance in miles.

These two facts mean you can draw a graph for converting between miles and kilometres.

If you extend the line far enough you can read higher values. Notice, for example, that the line passes through the point with coordinates (25, 40). This means that 25 miles is approximately 40 km.

![](images/e6ed10f9c4bd3f90f1ac0eb5d5b0a3606fa1555043e0a0efd9a247c7b6644019.jpg)

# MATHEMATICAL CONNECTIONS

You learned about line graphs and how to draw them in Chapter 4.

# LINK

Imperial units are still used in some countries. For example, the United States and United Kingdom often give road distances in miles and speed limits in miles per hour. In Europe, distances are in kilometres and speeds in kilometres per hour. Many cars have speedometers that show the speed in both systems, so it is easier to obey speed limits wherever you drive.

Check for yourself that you can see that the following are true:

10 miles is roughly  $16\mathrm{km}$

12 miles is roughly  $19\mathrm{km}$

$20\mathrm{km}$  is roughly 12.5 miles, and so on.

# 13.5 Exchanging currencies

You have used graphs to convert from one currency to another. However, if you know the exchange rate, then you can convert between currencies without a graph.

Calculating money involves working with decimals, because most currencies are decimals. Remember though, when you calculate with money you need to include the units (\$ or cents) in your answers.

The money a country uses is called its currency. Each country has its own currency and most currencies work on a decimal system (100 small units are equal to one main unit). The following table shows you the currency units of a few different countries.

# SUMMARY

# Do you know ...?

There are several measuring systems; the most common are metric and imperial.

Time is measured in different units, so you have to consider the conversion factors when you work with time.

Every measurement quoted to a given accuracy has a lower bound and an upper bound. The actual value of a measurement is greater than or equal to the lower bound, but strictly less than the upper bound.

You can draw a graph to help convert between different systems of units.

Countries use different currencies and you can convert between them if you know the exchange rate.

# MATHEMATICAL CONNECTIONS

You studied equations of straight lines in Chapter 10 and you already know how to solve equations with one unknown.

If you let  $x$  be the number of walks into the hills and  $y$  be the number of walks along the river, you can use the total number of walks to see that  $x + y = 8$ .

The total distance walking in the hills will be  $x \times 4 = 4x$  and the total distance walking along the river will be  $y \times 2 = 2y$ . So the total distance walked is  $4x + 2y$ , which must equal 26.

This gives two equations:

$$
x + y = 8
$$

$$
4 x + 2 y = 2 6
$$

The information has two unknown values and you can use it to form two different equations. The equations are both linear equations and you can plot them on the same pair of axes. There is only one point where the values of  $x$  and  $y$  are the same for both equations – this is where the lines cross (the intersection). This is the simultaneous solution.

![](images/fddf2629a7e3f6b0ca0edce33579c23b0b4e28bc786fc6f1da0048b8aa79a4b4.jpg)

Notice that the point with coordinates (5, 3) lies on both lines so,  $x = 5$  and  $y = 3$  satisfy both equations. You can check this by substituting the values into the equations:

$$
x + y = 5 + 3 = 8
$$

and

$$
4 x + 2 y = 4 (5) + 2 (3) = 2 0 + 6 = 2 6
$$

This means that there were five walks into the hills and three walks by the river.

# TIP

It is important that you remember to work out both unknowns. Every pair of simultaneous linear equations will have a pair of solutions.

# TIP

Simultaneous means, 'at the same time'. When you draw graphs of simultaneous linear equations you are looking for the point where two lines cross. The coordinates of this point give the  $x$  and  $y$  values which are solutions for both equations.

# LINK

Many problems in economics involve formulae containing several variables. When we try to answer financial questions – for example finding when a business venture breaks even or an investment gives the maximum return – we end up with several equations and several unknown values. This gives a set of simultaneous equations to solve.

# WORKED EXAMPLE 1

By drawing the graphs of each of the following equations on the same pair of axes, find the simultaneous solutions to the equations.

$$
\begin{array}{l} x - 3 y = 6 \\ 2 x + y = 5 \\ \end{array}
$$

# Answer

![](images/93190c418fe1d799e7dea3cfd420309c1bfd58add16dd0e1fac5765a944198fc.jpg)

For the first equation:

$$
\begin{array}{l} i f x = 0, - 3 y = 6 \Rightarrow y = - 2 \\ a n d, i f y = 0, x = 6 \\ \end{array}
$$

So this line passes through the points  $(0, -2)$  and  $(6, 0)$ .

For the second equation:

$$
i f x = 0, y = 5
$$

$$
\text {a n d , i f} y = 0, 2 x = 5 \Rightarrow x = \frac {5}{2}
$$

So this line passes through the points (0, 5) and  $\left(\frac{5}{2}, 0\right)$ .

Plot the pairs of points and draw lines through them.

Notice that the two lines meet at the point with coordinates  $(3, -1)$ .

So, the solution to the pair of equations is  $x = 3$  and  $y = -1$ .

# Exercise 14.1

1 Draw the lines for each pair of equations and then use the point of intersection to find the simultaneous solution. The axes that you should use are given in each case.

a  $x + 2y = 11$

$$
2 x + y = 1 0
$$

(x from 0 to 11 and y from 0 to 10)

b  $x - y = -1$

$$
2 x + y = 4
$$

(x from -2 to 3 and  $y$  from 0 to 4)

5x-4y=-1

$$
2 x + y = 1 0
$$

(x from -1 to 5 and y from 0 to 10)

# MATHEMATICAL CONNECTIONS

Throughout this chapter you will need to solve basic linear equations as part of the method. Look back to Chapter 6 if you need to remind yourself how to do this.

2 Use the graphs shown to find the solutions to the following pairs of simultaneous equations.

a  $y = x$

$$
y = - 2
$$

b  $y = x$

$$
y = 3 x - 6
$$

$y = 4 - 2x$

$$
y = - 2
$$

d  $y = 4 - 2x$

$$
y + 7 x + 1 = 0
$$

e  $y = -2$

$$
y + 7 x + 1 = 0
$$

f  $y = x$

$$
y = 4 - 2 x
$$

3 For each pair of equations, find three points on each line and draw the graphs. Use your graphs to estimate the solution of each pair of simultaneous equations.

a  $3y = -4x + 3$

$$
x = 2 y + 1
$$

b  $2 - x = -y$

$$
8 x + 4 y = 7
$$

$4x = 1 + 6y$

$$
4 x - 4 = 3 y
$$

d  $3x + 2y = 7$

$$
4 x = 2 + 3 y
$$

# Algebraic solution of simultaneous linear equations

The graphical method for solving simultaneous equations is suitable for whole number solutions but it can be slow and, for non-integer solutions, may not be as accurate as you need. You have already learnt how to solve linear equations with one unknown using algebraic methods. A pair of simultaneous equations gives information about two unknowns. You have to solve the equations together to find the solutions.

You are going to learn two methods of solving simultaneous equations:

- solving by substitution  
- solving by elimination.

# Solving by substitution

You can solve simultaneous equations by substitution by writing one of the equations in the form  $y = \ldots$  or  $x = \ldots$  and substituting into the other equation. The method is explained in the following worked example.

# WORKED EXAMPLE 2

Solve simultaneously by substitution.

$$
\begin{array}{l} 3 x - 2 y = 2 9 (1) \\ 4 x + y = 2 4 (2) \\ \end{array}
$$

# Answer

$$
\begin{array}{l} 4 x + y = 2 4 \\ y = 2 4 - 4 x \tag {3} \\ \end{array}
$$

$$
\begin{array}{l} 3 x - 2 y = 2 9 \tag {1} \\ 3 x - 2 (2 4 - 4 x) = 2 9 \\ 3 x - 4 8 + 8 x = 2 9 \\ 3 x + 8 x = 2 9 + 4 8 \\ \end{array}
$$

$$
\begin{array}{l} 1 1 x = 7 7 \\ x = 7 \\ \end{array}
$$

$$
\mathrm {S o}, x = 7
$$

$$
\begin{array}{l} y = 2 4 - 4 (7) \\ y = 2 4 - 2 8 \\ y = - 4 \\ x = 7 \text {a n d} y = - 4 \\ \end{array}
$$

Solve equation [2] for  $y$ .  
Label the new equation [3].

[1]

Substitute [3] into [1] by replacing  $y$  with  $24 - 4x$

Remove brackets.

Add 48 to both sides.

Add like terms.

Divide both sides by 11.

Now, substitute the value of  $x$  into any of the

Equations to find  $y$ . Equation [3] will be easiest,

so use this one.

Write out the solutions.

# MATHEMATICAL CONNECTIONS

The substitution method involves rearranging formulae to make one of the variables the subject. You learnt how to do this in Chapter 6.

# TIP

You should always number the

equations so you

can identify each

equation quickly

and easily.

# Solving by elimination

You can also solve simultaneous equations by eliminating (getting rid of) one of the variables.

# WORKED EXAMPLE 3

Solve the following pair of equations using elimination:

$$
x - y = 4 \tag {1}
$$

$$
x + y = 6 \tag {2}
$$

# Answer

$x - y = 4$  [1] You can add the two equations together by adding the  $x + y = 6$  [2] left-hand sides and adding the right-hand sides.

$$
2 x = 1 0
$$

$$
\begin{array}{l} 2 x = 1 0 \\ \Rightarrow x = \frac {1 0}{2} \\ x = 5 \\ \end{array}
$$

Notice that the equation that comes from this addition no longer contains a  $y$  term, so you can now solve to find the value of  $x$ .

$x + y = 6$  [2] You now need to find the  $y$  -value that goes with this  $5 + y = 6$  value of  $x$  .Substitute  $x$  into equation [2].

$$
y = 1
$$

$x - y = 5 - 1 = 4$  Check that these values for  $x$  and  $y$  work in equation [1].

Both equations are satisfied by the pair of values  $x = 5$  and  $y = 1$

The following worked examples look at different cases where you may need to subtract the equations, instead of adding, or where you need to multiply one or both equations before you add or subtract.

# WORKED EXAMPLE 4

Solve the following pairs of simultaneous equations:

$$
\begin{array}{l} 2 x - 3 y = - 8 \quad [ 1 ] \\ 5 x + 3 y = 1 \tag {2} \\ \end{array}
$$

# Answer

$$
\begin{array}{l} 2 x - 3 y = - 8 \\ 5 x + 3 y = 1 \\ 7 x = - 7 [ 1 ] + [ 2 ] \\ \Rightarrow x = - 1 \\ \end{array}
$$

Notice that both equations have the same coefficient of  $y$  though the signs are different. If you add the equations together, you make use of the fact that  $-3y + 3y = 0$

# TIP

Always line up' x's with 'x's, y's with 'y's and  $\mathbf{\Pi}^{\prime} = \mathbf{\Pi}^{\prime}$  with  $\mathbf{\Pi}^{\prime} = \mathbf{\Pi}^{\prime}$

It will make your method clearer.

# WORKED EXAMPLE 4 CONTINUED

$$
\begin{array}{l} 2 x - 3 y = - 8 \\ \Rightarrow 2 (- 1) - 3 y = - 8 \\ 6 - 3 y = 0 \\ 3 y = 6 \\ y = 2 \\ \end{array}
$$

Substitute in [1]

Now you know the value of  $x$ , you can substitute this into either equation and solve for  $y$ .

$$
\begin{array}{l} 5 x + 3 y = 5 (- 1) + 3 (2) \\ = - 5 + 6 = 1 \\ \end{array}
$$

Check your values in equation [2] to be sure.

The second equation is also satisfied by these values, so  $x = -1$  and  $y = 2$ .

# MATHEMATICAL CONNECTIONS

If you need to remind yourself about working with directed numbers, look back to Chapter 1. In particular, make sure you are confident subtracting negative numbers.

# WORKED EXAMPLE 5

Solve simultaneously:

$$
\begin{array}{l} 4 x + y = - 1 \tag {1} \\ 7 x + y = - 4 \quad [ 2 ] \\ \end{array}
$$

Answer

$$
\begin{array}{l} 7 x + y = - 4 \quad [ 2 ] - [ 1 ] \\ 4 x + y = - 1 \\ 3 x = - 3 \\ \Rightarrow x = - 1 \\ \end{array}
$$

The  $y$ -values have the same coefficient again, but this time they have the same sign. Use the fact that  $y - y = 0$  and subtract one equation from the other. There are more 'x's in equation [2] so, consider [2] - [1].

$$
4 x + y = - 1
$$

[1]

Substitute into equation [1].

$$
\begin{array}{l} \Rightarrow 4 (- 1) + y = - 1 \\ y = 3 \\ \end{array}
$$

$$
7 x + y = 7 (- 1) + 3
$$

Check that the values  $x = -1$  and  $y = 3$  work in equation [2].

Equation [2] is also satisfied by these values, so  $x = -1$  and  $y = 3$ .

# Manipulating equations before solving them

Sometimes you need to manipulate or rearrange one or both of the equations before you can solve them simultaneously by elimination. Worked examples 6 to 8 show you how this is done.

# TIP

Always make it clear which equation you have chosen to subtract from which.

Here, you have used the fact that  $-4 - (-1) = -3$ .

# WORKED EXAMPLE 6

Solve simultaneously:

$$
2 x - 5 y = 2 4 \tag {1}
$$

$$
4 x + 3 y = - 4 \tag {2}
$$

Answer

$$
2 \times [ 1 ]
$$

$$
4 x - 1 0 y = 4 8 \tag {3}
$$

Here, neither the coefficients of  $x$  nor the coefficients of  $y$  match. But, if you multiply equation [1] by 2, you can make the coefficient of  $x$  the same in each.

Call this new equation [3].

$$
4 x + 3 y = - 4 \quad [ 2 ]
$$

$$
4 x - 1 0 y = 4 8 \tag {3}
$$

Equations [2] and [3] have the same coefficient of  $x$ , so write these equations together and solve as before.

$$
4 x + 3 y = - 4 [ 2 ] - [ 3 ]
$$

$$
4 x - 1 0 y = 4 8
$$

$$
1 3 y = - 5 2
$$

$$
\Rightarrow y = - 4
$$

$$
2 x - 5 y = 2 4
$$

$$
\Rightarrow 2 x - 5 (- 4) = 2 4
$$

$$
2 x + 2 0 = 2 4
$$

$$
x = 2
$$

$$
4 x + 3 y = 4 (2) + 3 (- 4)
$$

Substitute  $y = -4$  into equation [1].

$$
= 8 - 1 2 = - 4
$$

So the pair of values  $x = 2$  and  $y = -4$  satisfy the pair of simultaneous equations.

# WORKED EXAMPLE 7

Solve simultaneously:

$$
2 x - 2 1 = 5 y
$$

$$
3 + 4 y = - 3 x
$$

Answer

Before you can work with these equations you need to rearrange them so they are in the same form.

$$
2 x - 5 y = 2 1
$$

[1]

In this pair, you cannot make the coefficients of  $x$ .

$$
3 x + 4 y = - 3
$$

or  $y$  match by multiplying just one equation.

# WORKED EXAMPLE 7 CONTINUED

$4\times [1]$

$$
8 x - 2 0 y = 8 4 \tag {3}
$$

$5\times [2]$

$$
1 5 x + 2 0 y = - 1 5 \tag {4}
$$

Here, you need to multiply each equation by a different value so that the coefficient of  $x$  or the coefficient of  $y$  match. It is best to choose to do this for the '  $y$  ' terms here because they have different signs and it is simpler to add equations rather than subtract!

$$
8 x - 2 0 y = 8 4 \quad [ 3 ] + [ 4 ]
$$

$$
1 5 x + 2 0 y = - 1 5

$$

$$
\Rightarrow x = 3

$$
2 x - 5 y = 2 1

$$
\Rightarrow 2 (3) - 5 y = 2 1

$$

Substitute for  $x$  in equation [1].

So  $x = 3$  and  $y = -3$  satisfy the pair of simultaneous equations.

# WORKED EXAMPLE 8

Solve simultaneously:

$$
\begin{array}{l} \frac {3 x - 4 y}{2} = 1 0 \quad [ 1 ] \\ \frac {3 x + 2 y}{4} = 2 \tag {2} \\ \end{array}
$$

Answer

$$
3 x - 4 y = 2 0
$$

In this pair of equations it makes sense to remove the fractions before you work with them. Multiply both sides of equation [1] by 2.

$$
3 x + 2 y = 8
$$

Multiply both sides of equation [2] by 4.

# WORKED EXAMPLE 8 CONTINUED

$3x - 4y = 20$  [3] - [4] Subtract equation [4] from equation [3].

$$
\begin{array}{l} 3 x + 2 y = 8 \\ - 6 y = 1 2 \\ y = - 2 \\ \end{array}
$$

$3x - 4(-2) = 20$  Substitute the value for  $y$  into equation [3].

$$
\begin{array}{l} 3 x + 8 = 2 0 \\ 3 x = 1 2 \\ x = 4 \\ \end{array}
$$

3(4) + 2(-2) = 12 - 4 = 8 Check using equation [4].

So  $x = 4$  and  $y = -2$  satisfy the pair of simultaneous equations.

# 14.2 Linear inequalities

When you solve linear equations you end up with a single solution for a single variable. Sometimes, however, there are situations where there are a range of possible solutions. This section extends your earlier work on linear equations to look at linear inequalities.

# Number lines

Imagine you are told that  $x < 4$ . You already know this means that each possible value of  $x$  must be less than 4. Therefore,  $x$  can be 3, 2, 1, 0, -1, -2, ... but that is not all. 3.2 is also less than 4, as is 3.999, 2.43, -3.4, -100, ...

If you draw a number line, you can use an arrow to represent the set of numbers less than 4:

![](images/e257d85aeeda75f2bd580960a9b5272df7bda6e73b95a0e81fbaaa90746bae40.jpg)

# LINK

You are already familiar with the idea of a number line. Both the  $x$ - and  $y$ -axes are examples of number lines.

Any kind of regular scale like a thermometer or tape measure used in a long jump pit, for example, is really a kind of number line.

This allows you to show the possible values of  $x$  neatly without writing them all down. (In fact, there is an infinite number of values, so you can't write them all down!) Notice that the 'open circle' above the four is not filled in. This symbol is used because it is not possible for  $x$  to be equal to four.

Now imagine that  $x \geq -2$ . This means that  $x$  can be greater than, or equal to  $-2$ . You can show that  $x$  can be equal to  $-2$  by 'filling in' the circle above  $-2$  on the number line:

![](images/be608d3b0cdd9d5596567a4f7dd8f562d97b7c36177ff8c863d32d194c61b403.jpg)

# MATHEMATICAL CONNECTIONS

Remind yourself how you used inequality symbols for grouped data in Chapter 12.

You will use inequalities again when you describe intervals and label histograms in Chapter 20.

# WORKED EXAMPLE 9

a Show the set of values that satisfy each of the following inequalities on a number line.

$$
i x > 3
$$

$$
i i \quad 4 <   y <   8
$$

$$
- 1. 4 <   x \leqslant 2. 8
$$

b List all integers that satisfy the inequality  $4.2 < x \leqslant 10.4$

# Answers

a i The values of  $x$  have to be larger than 3.  $x$  cannot be equal to 3, so do not fill in the circle. 'Greater than' means 'to the right' on the number line.

![](images/e75d9062bbc904aea962d7f06d09089a1a14c25125f928eb574259fd85a43b28.jpg)

ii Notice that  $y$  is now being used as the variable and this should be clearly labelled on your number line. Also, two inequality symbols have been used. In fact there are two inequalities, and both must be satisfied.

$4 < y$  means that  $y$  is greater than (but not equal) to 4.

$y < 8$  means that  $y$  is less than (but not equal to) 8.

So,  $y$  lies between 4 and 8 (not inclusive):

![](images/9157f954a26a4a567a42ba3ab6b402964dcb6cebe9166e425bc150c3215ec2ba.jpg)

iii This example has two inequalities that must both be satisfied.  $x$  is greater than (but not equal to) -1.4, and  $x$  is less than or equal to 2.8:

![](images/c67e4701dc34ee0a793028904c4a02b8f205295ed4a17d8693ec0316aa7c1081.jpg)

b  $x$  must be greater than, but not equal to 4.2, so the smallest possible value of  $x$  is 5.  $x$  must also be less than or equal to 10.4, so the largest possible value of  $x$  is 10.

The possible integer values of  $x$  are 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 or 10.

# Exercise 14.3

# Solving inequalities algebraically

Consider the inequality  $3x > 6$

Now, suppose that  $x = 2$ , then  $3x = 6$  but this doesn't quite satisfy the inequality! However, any value of  $x$  that is larger than 2 will work. For example:

If  $x = 2.1$ , then  $3x = 6.3$ , which is greater than 6.

In the same way that you could divide both sides of an equation by 3, both sides of the inequality can be divided by 3 to get the solution:

$$
\begin{array}{l} 3 x > 6 \\ \frac {3 x}{3} > \frac {6}{3} \\ x > 2 \end{array}
$$

Notice that this solution is a range of values of  $x$  rather than a single value. Any value of  $x$  that is greater than 2 is a solution.

You can solve any linear inequality in a similar way to how you would solve a linear equation. But there are important exceptions, which are described in the 'warning' section after Worked example 10. Most importantly, you should remember that what you do to one side of the inequality you must do to the other.

# WORKED EXAMPLE 10

Find the set of values of  $x$  which satisfy each of the following inequalities.

a  $3x - 4 <   14$

b  $4(x - 7)\geq 16$

c  $5x - 3\leqslant 2x + 18$

d  $4 - 7x\leqslant 53$

e  $-10\leqslant 3x - 2 <   4$

# Answers

a  $3x - 4 <   14$

$$
3 x <   1 8
$$

Add 4 to both sides.

$$
\frac {3 x}{3} <   \frac {1 8}{3}
$$

Divide both sides by 3.

$$
\mathrm {S o}, x <   6
$$

b  $4(x - 7)\geq 16$

$4x - 28\geq 16$

$$
4 x \geqslant 4 4
$$

$$
\frac {4 x}{4} \geqslant \frac {4 4}{4}
$$

$$
\mathrm {S o}, x \geqslant 1 1
$$

$$
4 (x - 7) \geqslant 1 6
$$

$$
x - 7 \geqslant 4
$$

$$
x \geqslant 1 1
$$

Expand the brackets.

Add 28 to both sides.

Divide both sides by 4.

You can also solve this inequality by dividing both sides by 4 at the beginning:

Divide both sides by 4.

Add 7 to both sides to get the same answer as before.

# MATHEMATICAL CONNECTIONS

There is a clear relationship between this method and how you solved equations in Chapter 6.

# WORKED EXAMPLE 10 CONTINUED

c  $5x - 3\leqslant 2x + 18$

$$
\begin{array}{l} 5 x - 3 - 2 x \leqslant 2 x + 1 8 - 2 x \\ 3 x - 3 \leqslant 1 8 \\ 3 x \leqslant 2 1 \\ x \leqslant 7 \\ \end{array}
$$

Subtract the smaller number of  $x$ 's from both sides (2x).

Simplify.

Add 3 to both sides.

Divide both sides by 3.

d  $4 - 7x\leqslant 53$

$$
4 \leqslant 5 3 + 7 x
$$

$$
- 4 9 \leqslant 7 x
$$

$$
- 7 \leqslant x
$$

And,  $x\geq -7$

Add 7x to both sides

Subtract 53 from both sides.

Divide both sides by 7.

The  $x$  is on the right-hand side of the inequality in this answer. This is acceptable. You can reverse the entire inequality to place the  $x$  on the left without changing its meaning, but remember to reverse the actual inequality symbol!

e  $-10\leqslant 3x - 2 <   4$

$$
\begin{array}{l} - 1 0 \leqslant 3 x - 2 \text {a n d} 3 x - 2 <   4 \\ - 8 \leqslant 3 x \\ - \frac {8}{3} \leqslant x \\ - \frac {8}{3} \leq x <   2 \\ \end{array}
$$

There are three parts to this inequality.

Split into two inequalities.

Solve each part.

Recombine the solutions.

# A warning

Before working through the next exercise you must understand and apply one further rule. Think about this inequality:

$$
\begin{array}{l} 3 - 5 x > 1 8 \\ \Rightarrow - 5 x > 1 5 \\ \end{array}
$$

If you divide both sides by  $-5$  it appears that the solution will be,

$$
x > - 3
$$

This is satisfied by any value of  $x$  that is greater than -3, for example -2, -1, 2.4, 3.5, 10 ...

If you calculate the value of  $3 - 5x$  for each of these values you get 13, 8, -9, -14.5, -47 ... and not one of these works in the original inequality as they are all smaller than 18.

Here is an alternative solution:

$$
3 - 5 x > 1 8
$$

$$
\begin{array}{l} \Rightarrow \quad 3 > 1 8 + 5 x \\ - 1 5 > 5 x \\ - 3 > x \\ \end{array}
$$

$$
\text {O r}, \quad x <   - 3
$$

This is a correct solution, and the final answer is very similar to the 'wrong' one above.

The only difference is that the inequality symbol has been reversed.

Why does this happen? When you multiply both sides by a negative value, the side that was greater will end up being a 'bigger' negative number, which actually means it is now less than the other side!

You need to remember the following:

If you multiply or divide both sides of an inequality by a negative number then you must reverse the direction of the inequality.

If you can avoid negatives, by adding or subtracting terms, then try to do so.

# REFLECTION

Have you completely understood this warning? How will you make sure you remember to reverse the inequality symbol at the right moment each time?

# 14.3 Regions in a plane

So far, you have only looked at inequalities involving a single variable. Now you will look at what happens when there are two variables connected with an inequality. In these situations you need to think about a region, which is a set of points in the coordinate plane.

# LINK

You will often hear the word 'region' used in geography. It refers to a section of land or sea contained within a boundary. The region might be a whole continent, a collection of countries or even a national park or shipping lane. These regions are often marked with clear boundaries on a map, or they may be shaded in different colours.

The diagram shows a broken line that is parallel to the  $x$ -axis. Every point on the line has a  $y$ -coordinate of 3. This means that the equation of the line is  $y = 3$ .

![](images/69edac9f4b97acac3dc37252f9cd0dba14ede0a1e329c62364370fbdcbc4adf8.jpg)

All of the points above the line  $y = 3$  have  $y$ -coordinates that are greater than 3. The region above the line represents the inequality  $y > 3$ . Similarly, the region below the line represents the inequality  $y < 3$ .

The regions  $y > 3$  and  $y < 3$  are shown on this diagram.

![](images/0ab828e5516cf80a8f4f37d4687dd28a02d9c4d5dd9270ccfe1814c00052055e.jpg)

In the diagram below, the graph of  $y = 2x + 1$  is shown as a broken line. Every point on the line has coordinates  $(x, y)$  which satisfy  $y = 2x + 1$ .

$Q$  is a point on the line. Point  $P$  has a  $y$ -coordinate that is greater than the  $y$ -coordinate of  $Q$ .  $P$  and  $Q$  have the same  $x$ -coordinate. This means that for any point  $P$  in the region above the line,  $y > 2x + 1$ .

![](images/40c3b4f73902857e66e78f7dec86554d1a539f5c1b2d1c06e04df625a67389ea.jpg)

The region above the line represents the inequality  $y > 2x + 1$ .

Similarly, the region below the line represents the inequality  $y < 2x + 1$ .

You can see this on the following diagram.

![](images/bfe125dc9491cc62293ec81c0008a94f7e0a7c74d4680a92416a4e35047b2ceb.jpg)

If the equation of the line is in the form  $y = mx + c$ , then:

the inequality  $y > mx + c$  is above the line  
the inequality  $y <   mx + c$  is below the line.

If the equation is not in the form  $y = mx + c$ , you have to find a way to check which region represents which inequality.

# WORKED EXAMPLE 11

On a diagram, show the regions that represent the inequalities  $2x - 3y < 6$  and  $2x - 3y > 6$ .

![](images/64b5f63914b1cd57f133ad0bb3881b09783413ec59155866f18269e3ce682a8b.jpg)  
Answer

The boundary between the two required regions is the line  $2x - 3y = 6$

This line crosses the  $x$ -axis at  $(3,0)$  and the  $y$ -axis at  $(0, -2)$ . It is shown as a broken line in the diagram.

Consider any point in the region above the line. The easiest point to use is the origin  $(0,0)$ . When  $x = 0$  and  $y = 0$ ,  $2x - 3y = 0$ . Since 0 is less than 6, the region above the line represents the inequality  $2x - 3y < 6$ .

# Rules for boundaries and shading of regions

You have already seen inequalities are not always  $<$  or  $>$ . They may also be  $\leqslant$  or  $\geqslant$ . Graphical representations have to show the difference between these variations.

When the inequality includes equal to  $(\leqslant$  or  $\geqslant$  ), the boundary line must be included in the graphical representation. It is therefore shown as a solid line.

When the inequality does not include equal to  $(< \text{or} >)$ , the boundary line is not included in the graphical representation, so it is shown as a broken line.

# TIP

Sometimes it is better to shade out the unwanted region.

# WORKED EXAMPLE 12

By shading the unwanted region, show the region that represents the inequality  $3x - 5y \leqslant 15$ .

# Answer

![](images/f331557493516c2de28b36e439b594cf304f074f91a7f203710dda807368e831.jpg)

The boundary line is  $3x - 5y = 15$  and it is included in the region (because the inequality includes equal to).

This line crosses the  $x$  -axis at (5, 0) and crosses the  $y$  -axis at  $(0, - 3)$  .It is shown as a solid line in the diagram.

When  $x = 0$  and  $y = 0$ ,  $3x - 5y = 0$ . Since 0 is less than 15, the origin (0, 0) is in the required region. (Alternatively, rearrange  $3x - 5y \leqslant 15$  to get  $y \geqslant \frac{3}{5}x - 3$  and deduce that the required region is above the line.) The unshaded region in this diagram represents the inequality  $3x - 5y \leqslant 15$ .

# WORKED EXAMPLE 13

By shading the unwanted region, show the region that represents the inequality  $3x - 2y \geq 0$ .

# Answer

![](images/03c338337a682ed02b0cefc3dd2304249ad2303e38924afee579c89a236bbafe.jpg)

You cannot take the origin as the checking point because it lies on the boundary line. Instead take the point  $P(0,2)$ , which is above the line. When  $x = 0$  and  $y = 2$ ,  $3x - 2y = -4$ , which is less than 0. Hence  $P$  is not in the required region.

The boundary line is  $3x - 2y = 0$  and it is included in the region. It is shown as a solid line in the diagram.

# WORKED EXAMPLE 14

Find the inequality that is represented by the unshaded region in this diagram.

![](images/8c98cf8f6669d84114baad161e1c4cf4294f1503e44baa5bd924bebd404d2d85.jpg)

# Answer

First find the equation of the boundary. Its gradient  $= \frac{-4}{2} = -2$  and its intercept on the  $y$ -axis is  $y = 4$ . Therefore the boundary line is  $y = -2x + 4$ . This can be rewritten as  $y + 2x = 4$ . Take  $P(3,2)$  in the unshaded region as the check-point:  $2 + 6 = 8$ . Note that 8 is greater than 4 and hence the unshaded region represents  $y + 2x > 4$ . As the boundary is a broken line, it is not included, and so the sign is not  $\geq$ .

# Exercise 14.5

For questions 1 to 3, show your answers on a grid with  $x$ - and  $y$ -axes running from -3 to +4.

3 By shading the unwanted region, show the region that represents the inequality  $x - y \geq 0$ .  
4 Shade the region that represents each inequality.

a  $y > 3 - {3x}$

b  $3x - 2y\geq 6$

c  $x\leqslant 5$

d  $y > 3$

$x + 3y\leqslant 10$

[ - 3 < x < 5]

5 Copy and complete these statements by choosing the correct option:

a If  $y <   mx + c$  , shade the unwanted region above/below the graph of  $y = mx + c$  
b If  $y > mx + c$ , shade the unwanted region above/below the graph of  $y = mx + c$ .  
For  $y < m_{1}x + c_{1}$  and  $y > m_{2}x + c_{2}$ , shade the unwanted region above/below the graph of  $y = m_{1}x + c_{1}$  and/or above/below the graph of  $y = m_{2}x + c_{2}$ .

# Representing simultaneous inequalities

When two or more inequalities have to be satisfied at the same time, they are called simultaneous inequalities. These can also be represented graphically. On the diagram in Worked example 15 the inequalities are represented by regions on the same diagram. The unwanted regions are shaded or crossed out. The unshaded region will contain all the coordinates  $(x, y)$  that satisfy all the inequalities simultaneously.

# MATHEMATICAL CONNECTIONS

You studied simultaneous equations at the start of this chapter, and you saw that the solution was where two lines intersected. In this section, simultaneous inequalities show where two or more regions intersect.

# WORKED EXAMPLE 15

By shading the unwanted regions, show the region defined by the set of inequalities  $y < x + 2$ ,  $y \leq 4$  and  $x \leq 3$ .

![](images/abf56583c00d667bfa17f4d216374c7543542ab09c72812878449b80e94cb0f3.jpg)  
Answer

The boundaries of the required region are  $y = x + 2$  (broken line),  $y = 4$  (solid line) and  $x = 3$  (solid line).

Start by drawing the line  $y = x + 2$ .  $y < x + 2$  so shade the unwanted region above the line.

Continue drawing the other boundary lines and shading the unwanted regions.

The unshaded region in the diagram represents the set of inequalities

$$
y <   x + 2, y \leqslant 4 \text {a n d} x \leqslant 3.
$$

Notice that this region does not have a finite area - it is not 'closed'.

# 14.4 Completing the square

# MATHEMATICAL CONNECTIONS

The material here builds on everything you learnt about quadratic expressions in Chapter 10. Make sure you have reviewed that work before you start this section.

Compare these two quadratic expressions:

$$
\begin{array}{l} x ^ {2} + 6 x + 9 \\ x ^ {2} + 6 x - 7 \\ \end{array}
$$

You should recognise from your work in Chapter 10 that the first expression is a perfect square and that it factorises to give two identical factors:

$$
x ^ {2} + 6 x + 9 = (x + 3) (x + 3) = (x + 3) ^ {2}.
$$

The second quadratic is not the square of a single bracket, but you can use a similar idea to write it in a different way that does involve a square bracket. This is useful when you cannot factorise the expression but need to solve an equation. It is also very useful when learning about the symmetry of quadratic graphs in Chapter 18.

Compare the two expressions again and write the second quadratic using a squared bracket:

$$
\begin{array}{l} x ^ {2} + 6 x + 9 = (x + 3) ^ {2} \\ x ^ {2} + 6 x - 7 = (x + 3) ^ {2} - 1 6 \quad \text {S u b t r a c t} 1 6 \text {f r o m} - 7 \text {y o u n e e d}. \\ \end{array}
$$

# TIP

Notice that the two quadratics are very similar. The only difference is that the constant term in the second one is 16 less than in the first.

Notice that the coefficient of  $x$  in the original expression is twice the constant inside the bracket. The coefficient of  $x$  is always twice the constant inside the bracket you are squaring, because:

$$
(x + a) ^ {2} = (x + a) (x + a) = x ^ {2} + 2 a x + a ^ {2}
$$

The method of rewriting a quadratic expression in the form  $(x + p)^2 + q$  is called completing the square

# WORKED EXAMPLE 16

Rewrite the expression  $x^{2} - 4x + 11$  in the form  $(x + p)^{2} + q$ .

# Answer

The coefficient of  $x$  is -4. Half of this is -2.

So start by thinking about  $(x - 2)^2 = x^2 - 4x + 4$ .

You need to add 7 to make the constant equal to 11, so

$$
x ^ {2} - 4 x + 1 1 = (x - 2) ^ {2} + 7.
$$

# WORKED EXAMPLE 17

a Write the expression  $x^{2} + 4x - 6$  in the form  $(x + p)^2 +q$  
b Hence solve  $x^{2} + 4x - 6 = 0$  giving your answers to 2 decimal places.

# Answers

a Try  $(x + 2)^2 = x^2 + 4x + 4$

The coefficient of  $x$  in  $x^2 + 4x - 6$  is 4. Half of this is 2.

$$
\begin{array}{l} (x + 2) ^ {2} - 1 0 = x ^ {2} + 4 x + 4 - 1 0 \\ = x ^ {2} + 4 x - 6 \\ \end{array}
$$

Subtract 10 from both sides to make the constant term  $-6$ .

b  $x^{2} + 4x - 6 = 0$

$$
\begin{array}{l} (x + 2) ^ {2} - 1 0 = 0 \\ (x + 2) ^ {2} = 1 0 \\ x + 2 = \pm \sqrt {1 0} \\ x = - 2 \pm \sqrt {1 0} \\ \end{array}
$$

$$
x = 1. 1 6 \text {o r} x = - 5. 1 6

# TIP

You will usually be told when to use completing the square.

# TIP

The square root symbol means only the positive square root. There are two different numbers that square to give 10. These are  $\sqrt{10}$  and  $-\sqrt{10}$ . You must include the  $\pm$  symbol so that you find both solutions.

3 Solve each equation by completing the square.

Mathematics often involves building new ideas on earlier ones. What difficulties might you have learning new ideas if there are earlier ideas that you do not fully understand?

# Completing the square when the coefficient of  $x$  is not 1

Sometimes you will need to write an expression in completed square form when the coefficient of  $x$  is not equal to 1. This means that you will need a number other than 1 in front of the squared bracket. Read through Worked example 18 to see how to do this.

# WORKED EXAMPLE 18

# 14.5 Quadratic formula

If you complete the square for the general form of a quadratic equation  $(ax^2 + bx + c = 0)$ , the following result is produced:

$$
\text {I f} a x ^ {2} + b x + c = 0 \text {t h e n} x = \frac {- b \pm \sqrt {b ^ {2} - 4 a c}}{2 a}
$$

This is known as the quadratic formula.

Notice the  $\pm$  symbol. This tells you that you should calculate two values: one with a  $+$  and one with a  $-$  in the position occupied by the  $\pm$ . You can use the quadratic formula to solve any quadratic equation even if you cannot factorise the quadratic expression.

The advantage of the quadratic formula over completing the square is that you don't have any extra steps to include when the coefficient of  $x^2$  is not 1.

# TIP

Remember that half

$$
\text {o f} \frac {5}{3} \text {i s} \frac {5}{6}.
$$

# TIP

If you are asked to give solutions to a number of decimal places or significant figures or to leave the answer in surd form it is a good indication that you cannot factorise the expression and you should use the formula or complete the square instead.

# DISCUSSION

By starting with  $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$  and dividing every term by  $a$  it is possible to use completing the square to get the formula above. Work with a partner or your teacher to see if you can get to the formula from the original quadratic equation.

# MATHEMATICAL CONNECTIONS

You saw in Chapter 2 that the coefficient of a variable is the number that multiplies it. This is still true for quadratic equations:  $a$  is the coefficient of  $x^2$  and  $b$  is the coefficient of  $x$ .  $c$  is the constant term.

# WORKED EXAMPLE 19

Solve the following quadratic equations, giving your answers to 3 significant figures.

a  $x^{2} + 4x + 3 = 0$

b  $x^{2} - 7x + 11 = 0$

$3x^{2} - 2x - 1 = 0$

# Answers

a Compare the quadratic equation  $x^{2} + 4x + 3 = 0$  with  $ax^2 +bx + c = 0$  From this you can see that  $a = 1$ $b = 4$  and  $c = 3$

$$
\begin{array}{l} x = \frac {- b \pm \sqrt {b ^ {2} - 4 a c}}{2 a} = \frac {- 4 \pm \sqrt {4 ^ {2} - 4 \times 1 \times 3}}{2 \times 1} \\ = - 4 \pm \frac {1 6 - 1 2}{2} \\ = \frac {- 4 \pm \sqrt {4}}{2} \\ = \frac {- 4 \pm 2}{2} \\ \end{array}
$$

$$
S _ {0}, x = \frac {- 4 + 2}{2} = \frac {- 2}{2} = - 1 \text {o r} x = \frac {- 4 - 2}{2} = \frac {- 6}{2} = - 3
$$

Notice that the original quadratic equation can be factorised to give  $(x + 1)(x + 3) = 0$  and the same solutions. If you can factorise the quadratic then you should because the method is much simpler.

Here you need to take particular care. BODMAS always applies and you should check the order of your working, and your solution, carefully.

# TIP

It is more accurate to leave your answer in surd form than to convert to a decimal. Surds are exact, but decimals are approximations.

# MATHEMATICAL CONNECTIONS

You learnt how to work with surds in Chapter 9. Review that work if you need to.

# TIP

Notice that there are brackets around the -7. If you miss these the calculation becomes  $-7^{2} = -49$  rather than  $+49$ .

If  $b$  is negative always use brackets to make sure that you square it correctly.

Artificial intelligence (AI) engines allow computer programmes such as Mathematica and Wolfram Alpha to do almost all complex calculations (including solving quadratic equations) faster than most people can do by hand. Stephen Wolfram is a physicist who developed these programmes to do the maths he needed (and struggled to do). Programmes like this are able to carry out standard calculations much more quickly than humans can.

# TIP

You must make sure that your equation takes the form of a quadratic expression equal to zero.

If it does not, then you will need to collect all terms on to one side so that a zero appears on the other side!

7 A biologist claims that the average height,  $h$  metres, of trees of a certain species after  $t$  months is given by  $h = \frac{1}{5} t^{\frac{1}{2}} + \frac{1}{3} t^{\frac{1}{3}}$ .

For this model:

a find the average height of trees of this species after 64 months  
find the number of months that the trees have been growing when the model predicts an average height of 10 metres. Give your answer to 3 significant figures.

# TIP

Let  $x = t^{\frac{1}{2}}$ .

Form and solve a quadratic in  $x$ .

# REFLECTION

Did you make any mistakes with negative coefficients of  $x$ ? How did you correct them and how will you avoid making the same mistake in the future?

# 14.6 Factorising quadratics where the coefficient of  $x^2$  is not 1

The quadratic equation in part (c) of Worked example 19 gave two solutions that could have been obtained by factorisation. It turns out that  $(x - 1)(3x + 1) = 3x^2 - 2x - 1$  (you can check this by expanding the brackets).

In general, if the coefficient of  $x^2$  in a quadratic is a number other than 1 you need to carry out more steps to factorise the expression.

# WORKED EXAMPLE 21

Factorise each of the following expressions:

a  $2x^{2} + 3x + 1$

b  $3x^{2} - 14x + 8$

6x²+14x-12

d  $10x^{2} + 11x - 8$

# Answers

a  $2x^{2} + 3x + 1$

$$
2 x ^ {2} + 3 x + 1 = (2 x) (x)
$$

The only way to produce the term  $2x^{2}$  is to multiply  $2x$  and  $x$ . Place these two terms at the front of each bracket. There are blank spaces in the brackets because you don't yet know what else needs to be included. The clue lies in the constant term at the end, which is obtained by multiplying these two unknown values together.

The constant term is 1, so the only possible values are +1 or -1. Since the constant term is positive, the unknown values must be either both -1 or both +1.

Try each of these combinations systematically:

$(2x - 1)(x - 1) = 2x^{2} - 3x + 1$

The coefficient of  $x$  is wrong.

$(2x + 1)(x + 1) = 2x^{2} + 3x + 1$

This is correct.

So,  $2x^{2} + 3x + 1 = (2x + 1)(x + 1)$

# WORKED EXAMPLE 21 CONTINUED

b  $3x^{2} - 14x + 8$

Start by writing  $3x^{2} - 14x + 8 = (3x)(x)$

The two unknown terms must multiply to give 8. Since the constant term is positive, the unknowns must have the same sign. The possible pairs are:

8 and 1 2 and 4 -8 and -1 -2 and -4

Try each pair in turn, remembering that you can reverse the order:

$$
(3 x + 8) (x + 1) = 3 x ^ {2} + 3 x + 8 x + 8 = 3 x ^ {2} + 1 1 x + 8 \quad \text {I n c o r r e c t}
$$

$$
(3 x + 1) (x + 8) = 3 x ^ {2} + 2 4 x + x + 8 = 3 x ^ {2} + 2 5 x + 8 \quad \text {I n c o r r e c t}
$$

$$
(3 x + 2) (x + 4) = 3 x ^ {2} + 1 2 x + 2 x + 8 = 3 x ^ {2} + 1 4 x + 8 \quad \text {I n c o r r e c t}
$$

This last one is very close. You just need to change the sign of the 'x' term. This can be done by jumping to the last pair: -2 and -4.

$$
(3 x - 2) (x - 4) = 3 x ^ {2} - 1 2 x - 2 x + 8 = 3 x ^ {2} - 1 4 x + 8 \quad \text {C o r r e c t}
$$

$$
S _ {0}, 3 x ^ {2} - 1 4 x + 8 = (3 x - 2) (x - 4)
$$

c  $6x^{2} + 14x - 12 = 2(3x^{2} + 7x - 6)$  Take out the common factor first.

Write the pair of brackets; the factors have to be  $3x$  and  $x$ :

$$
6 x ^ {2} + 1 4 x - 1 2 = 2 (3 x) (x)
$$

The two unknown terms must multiply to give  $-6$ , because you have taken out the common factor 2. The possible pairs are:

2 and -3 3 and -2 6 and -1 -6 and 1

Test the pairs until you find the correct combination.

You will find that:

$$
6 x ^ {2} + 1 4 x - 1 2 = 2 (3 x - 2) (x + 3)
$$

d  $10x^{2} + 11x - 8$

This question requires more thought because there is more than one way to multiply two expressions to get  $10x^{2}$ :

2x and 5x or 10x and x.

Each possibility needs to be tried.

Start with  $10x^{2} + 11x - 8 = (10x)(x)$

Factor pairs that multiply to give -8 are:

-8 and 1 8 and -1 2 and -4 -2 and 4

Remember that you will need to try each pair with the two values in either order.

For this particular quadratic you will find that none of the eight possible combinations works!

Instead, you must now try:  $10x^{2} + 11x - 8 = (5x)(2x)$ .

Trying the above set of pairs once again you will eventually find that:

$$
1 0 x ^ {2} + 1 1 x - 8 = (5 x + 8) (2 x - 1)
$$

# Exercise 14.10

12x²+8x-15

Here is another method for factorising a quadratic like those in the previous exercise.

# WORKED EXAMPLE 22

Factorise  $10x^{2} + 11x - 8$

# Answer

$10 \times -8 = -80$

Multiply the coefficient of  $x^2$  by the constant term.

-1, 80 (no)  
List the factor pairs of -80 until you obtain a pair that totals the coefficient of  $x$ , which is 11.  
-2, 40 (no)  
(Note that as 11 is positive and -80 is negative, the larger number of the pair must be positive and the other negative.)

$10x^{2} - 5x + 16x - 8$

Rewrite the  $x$  term using this factor pair.

$5x(2x - 1) + 8(2x - 1)$

Factorise pairs of terms.

$(5x + 8)(2x - 1)$

(Be careful with signs here so that the second bracket is the same as the first bracket.)

Factorise, using the bracket as the common term.

# 14.7 Algebraic fractions

You will now use several of the techniques covered so far in this chapter to simplify complex algebraic fractions.

You already know that you can simplify fractions by dividing the numerator and denominator by a common factor. This can also be done with algebraic fractions.

# MATHEMATICAL CONNECTIONS

You revised highest common factors (HCFs) in Chapter 1.

# WORKED EXAMPLE 23

Simplify each of the following fractions as far as possible:

3x a 6

b y

12p3 16p7

d  $\frac{x^2 - 4x + 3}{x^2 - 7x + 12}$

# Answers

a  $\frac{3x}{6}$

$$
\frac {3 x}{6} = \frac {3 x \div 3}{6 \div 3} = \frac {x}{2}
$$

The highest common factor (HCF) of 3 and 6 is 3.

b  $\frac{y^2}{y^5}$

$$
\frac {y ^ {2}}{y ^ {5}} = \frac {y ^ {2} \div y ^ {2}}{y ^ {5} \div y ^ {2}} = \frac {1}{y ^ {3}}
$$

The HCF of  $y^{2}$  and  $y^{3}$  is  $y^{2}$ .

12p3 16p7

$$
\frac {1 2 p ^ {3}}{1 6 p ^ {7}} = \frac {3 p ^ {3}}{4 p ^ {7}}
$$

Consider the constants first.

$$
= \frac {3}{4 p ^ {4}}
$$

The HCF of 12 and 16 is 4, so you can divide both 12 and 16 by 4.

The HCF of  $p^3$  and  $p^7$  is  $p^3$ . You can divide both the numerator and the denominator by this HCF.

d  $\frac{x^2 - 4x + 3}{x^2 - 7x + 12}$

Notice that you can factorise both the numerator and the denominator.

$$
\begin{array}{l} \frac {x ^ {2} - 4 x + 3}{x ^ {2} - 7 x + 1 2} = \frac {(x - 3) (x - 1)}{(x - 3) (x - 4)} \\ = \frac {(x - 3) (x - 1)}{(x - 3) (x - 4)} \\ = \frac {(x - 1)}{(x - 4)} \\ \end{array}
$$

$(x - 3)$  is a factor of both the numerator and the denominator, so you can cancel this common factor.

# Exercise 14.12

# Multiplying and dividing algebraic fractions

# MATHEMATICAL CONNECTIONS

You learned how to multiply and divide numerical fractions in Chapter 5.

Consider the following multiplication:  $\frac{x}{y^2} \times \frac{y^4}{x^3}$ .

You already know that the numerators and denominators can be multiplied in the

usual way:  $\frac{x}{y^2} \times \frac{y^4}{x^3} = \frac{xy^4}{y^2x^3}$ .

Now you can see that the HCF of the numerator and denominator is  $xy^2$ . If you divide

through by  $xy^2$  you get:  $\frac{x}{y^2} \times \frac{y^4}{x^3} = \frac{y^2}{x^2}$ .

The following worked example will help you to understand the process for slightly more complicated multiplications and divisions.

# WORKED EXAMPLE 24

Simplify each of the following.

$$
a \frac {4}{3 x ^ {2}} \times \frac {1 4 x ^ {3}}{1 6 y ^ {2}}

$$

Multiply the numerators and the denominators and then simplify using the methods you have just learnt.

$$
\begin{array}{l} b \frac {3 (x + y) ^ {3}}{1 6 z ^ {2}} \times \frac {1 2 z}{9 (x + y) ^ {7}} \\ \frac {3 (x + y) ^ {3}}{1 6 z ^ {2}} \times \frac {1 2 z}{9 (x + y) ^ {7}} = \frac {3 6 (x + y) ^ {3} z}{1 4 4 (x + y) ^ {7} z ^ {2}} = \frac {1}{4 (x + y) ^ {4} z} \\ \end{array}
$$

$$
\begin{array}{l} c \frac {1 4 x ^ {4} y ^ {3}}{9} \div \frac {7 x ^ {2} y}{1 8} \\ \frac {1 4 x ^ {4} y ^ {3}}{9} + \frac {7 x ^ {2} y}{1 8} = \frac {1 4 x ^ {4} y ^ {3}}{9} \times \frac {1 8}{7 x ^ {2} y} = \frac {1 4 x ^ {4} y ^ {3} \times 1 8}{9 \times 7 x ^ {2} y} = 4 x ^ {2} y ^ {2} \\ \end{array}
$$

# REFLECTION

The multiplication or division was carried out before any simplification in these examples, but you have already seen that it is possible to cancel first. Try the worked example questions for yourself, but cancel before multiplying or dividing and see if you can get the same answer.

$\frac{1}{x} + \frac{1}{y} = \frac{y}{xy} + \frac{x}{xy} = \frac{y + x}{xy}$  The lowest common multiple of  $x$  and  $y$  is  $xy$ . This will be the common denominator.

Write as a single fraction in its lowest terms,  $\frac{1}{x + 1} + \frac{1}{x + 2}$

# Answer

The lowest common multiple of  $(x + 1)$  and  $(x + 2)$  is  $(x + 1)(x + 2)$ .

$$
\begin{array}{l} \frac {1}{x + 1} + \frac {1}{x + 2} = \frac {x + 2}{(x + 1) (x + 2)} + \frac {x + 1}{(x + 1) (x + 2)} \\ = \frac {x + 2 + x + 1}{(x + 1) (x + 2)} \\ = \frac {2 x + 3}{(x + 1) (x + 2)} \\ \end{array}
$$

# WORKED EXAMPLE 27

Write as a single fraction in its lowest terms,  $\frac{3x + 4}{x^2 + x - 6} - \frac{1}{x + 3}$

# Answer

First you should factorise the quadratic expression:

$$
\frac {3 x + 4}{x ^ {2} + x - 6} - \frac {1}{x + 3} = \frac {3 x + 4}{(x + 3) (x - 2)} - \frac {1}{(x + 3)}
$$

The two denominators have a common factor of  $(x + 3)$ , and the lowest common multiple of these two denominators is  $(x + 3)(x - 2)$ :

$$
\begin{array}{l} \frac {3 x + 4}{x ^ {2} + x - 6} - \frac {1}{x + 3} = \frac {3 x + 4}{(x + 3) (x - 2)} - \frac {1}{(x + 3)} \\ = \frac {3 x + 4}{(x + 3) (x - 2)} - \frac {(x - 2)}{(x + 3) (x - 2)} \\ = \frac {3 x + 4 - (x - 2)}{(x + 3) (x - 2)} \\ = \frac {3 x + 4 - x + 2}{(x + 3) (x - 2)} \\ = \frac {2 x + 6}{(x + 3) (x - 2)} \\ \end{array}
$$

This may appear to be the final answer, but if you factorise the numerator you will find that more can be done!

$$
\begin{array}{l} \frac {3 x + 4}{x ^ {2} + x - 6} - \frac {1}{x + 3} = \frac {2 x + 6}{(x + 3) (x - 2)} \\ = \frac {2 (x + 3)}{(x + 3) (x - 2)} \\ = \frac {2}{(x - 2)} \\ \end{array}
$$

# TIP

Always check to see if your final numerator can be factorised. If it can, then there may be more stages to go.

# SUMMARY

# Do you know ...?

Simultaneous means at the same time.

The intersection of two straight lines is the simultaneous solution of their equations.

Simultaneous linear equations can be solved graphically or algebraically.

Inequalities represent a range of solutions.

Inequalities in one variable can be represented on a number line and inequalities in two variables as a region on a plane.

A quadratic expression,  $x^{2} + bx + c$  can be written in the completed square form as  $\left(x + \frac{b}{2}\right)^2 - \left(\frac{b}{2}\right)^2 + c$ .

Quadratic equations that do not factorise can be solved by completing the square or by using the quadratic formula.

$$
\text {I f} a x ^ {2} + b x + c = 0 \text {t h e n} x = \frac {- b \pm \sqrt {b ^ {2} - 4 a c}}{2 a}.
$$

Complex algebraic fractions can be simplified by factorising and cancelling like terms.

# >Chapter 15 Scale drawings, bearings and trigonometry

# IN THIS CHAPTER YOU WILL:

- interpret scale drawings  
calculate bearings  
calculate sine, cosine and tangent ratios for right-angled triangles  
- use sine, cosine and tangent ratios to calculate the angles and lengths of sides of right-angled triangles  
- solve trigonometric equations, finding all the solutions between  $0^{\circ}$  and  $360^{\circ}$  
- apply the sine and cosine rules to calculate unknown sides and angles in triangles that are not right-angled  
calculate the area of a triangle that is not right-angled using the sine ratio  
- use the sine, cosine and tangent ratios, together with Pythagoras' theorem in three-dimensions  
- use exact sine, cosine and tangent ratios for certain angles.

To 'get your bearings' means to find out where you are and the direction you need to move in. Satnavs and the Global Positioning System (GPS) can make it much easier to work out where you are going. Their software uses the mathematical principles of calculating angles that you will learn about in this chapter.

The image on the previous page shows a 'radar' screen. If you imagine the centre of the screen represents your position, you can then start to work out how far away other objects are and in which direction. How do you think the diagram works?

# GETTING STARTED

1 The scale on a map is 1:50000. The measured distance between two points on the map is  $3.9\mathrm{cm}$

A class is asked to work out the actual distance between the two points in kilometres. Here are three students' solutions:

<table><tr><td>Student A</td><td>Student B</td><td>Student C</td></tr><tr><td>1/50000 × 3.9/1=0.000058cm=0.58km</td><td>Map distance = 39mmScale = 1:50000Real distance=39 × 50000=1950000mm=19.5km</td><td>3.9 × 50000 = 195000The distance is:190000cm÷100 = 1950m÷1000 = 1.95km</td></tr></table>

a Which student has worked it out correctly?

b What mistakes did the other two make?

2 The City of Mahlerville is building a new concert hall with 3000 seats inside. The architects create a 1:500 scale model of the hall. How many seats will the model have?  
3 A tiny insect is  $0.32\mathrm{mm}$  long and  $0.08\mathrm{mm}$  wide. A biologist is making a scale model of the insect. If the model is  $14.4\mathrm{cm}$  wide, how long will it be?

# 15.1 Scale drawings

Later in this chapter you will learn how to use the trigonometric ratios to accurately calculate missing angles and sides. For this you will need to use a calculator. Missing lengths and angles can also be found using scale drawings; although this is less accurate, it is still valid. For scale drawings you will need a ruler, a protractor and a sharp pencil.

Sometimes you have to draw a diagram to represent something that is much bigger than you can fit on the paper or so small that it would be very difficult to make out any detail. Examples include a plan of a building, a map of a country or the design of a microchip. These accurate diagrams are called scale drawings.

The lines in the scale drawing are all the same fraction of the lines they represent in reality. This fraction is called the scale of the drawing. The scale of a diagram, or a map, may be given as a fraction or a ratio such as  $\frac{1}{50000}$  or  $1:50000$ .

<table><tr><td>KEY WORDS</td></tr><tr><td>adjacent</td></tr><tr><td>bearing</td></tr><tr><td>cosine ratio</td></tr><tr><td>cosine rule</td></tr><tr><td>inverse function</td></tr><tr><td>opposite</td></tr><tr><td>projection</td></tr><tr><td>scale</td></tr><tr><td>sine ratio</td></tr><tr><td>sine rule</td></tr><tr><td>tangent ratio</td></tr></table>

A scale of  $\frac{1}{50000}$  means the length of every line in the diagram is  $\frac{1}{50000}$  of the length of the line that it represents in real life. So,  $1\mathrm{cm}$  in the diagram represents  $50000\mathrm{cm}$  in real life. In other words,  $1\mathrm{cm}$  represents  $500\mathrm{m}$ , or  $2\mathrm{cm}$  represents  $1\mathrm{km}$ .

# MATHEMATICAL CONNECTIONS

Some of the construction skills from Chapter 3 will be useful for scale drawings.

# LINK

Scale drawings are often used to plan the production of items in design technology subjects. Many problems that involve fitting together different shapes can be solved by using a good quality scale drawing. Maps in geography are also scale drawings and allow us to represent the real world in a conveniently sized diagram.

A rectangular field is  $100\mathrm{m}$  long and  $45\mathrm{m}$  wide. A scale drawing of the field is made with a scale of  $1\mathrm{cm}$  to  $10\mathrm{m}$ . What are the length and width of the field in the drawing?

# Answer

10m is represented by 1cm

:  $100\mathrm{m}$  is represented by  $(100\div 10)\mathrm{cm} = 10\mathrm{cm}$

and  $45\mathrm{m}$  is represented by  $(45\div 10)\mathrm{cm} = 4.5\mathrm{cm}$

So, the dimensions on the drawing are: length  $= 10\mathrm{cm}$  and width  $= 4.5\mathrm{cm}$

# LINK

Today most draughtspeople, architects and designers use computers to generate accurate scale diagrams and plans, but most of these designs start with hand-drawn sketches using pencils, rulers and compasses. Often the changes to plans will be accurately drawn over the computer designs before a final design is reached.

# Exercise 15.1

1 On the plan of a house, the living room is  $3.4\mathrm{cm}$  long and  $2.6\mathrm{cm}$  wide. The scale of the plan is  $1\mathrm{cm}$  to  $2\mathrm{m}$ . Calculate the actual length and width of the room.  
2 The actual distance between two villages is  $12\mathrm{km}$ . Calculate the distance between the villages on a map whose scale is:

1cm to 4km

b 1cm to 5km.

3 A car ramp is  $28\mathrm{m}$  long and makes an angle of  $15^{\circ}$  with the horizontal.

A scale drawing is made of the ramp using a scale of  $1\mathrm{cm}$  to  $5\mathrm{m}$

a How long is the ramp on the drawing?  
b What angle does the ramp make with the horizontal on the drawing?

# Angle of elevation and angle of depression

Scale drawing questions often involve observations of objects that are higher than you or lower than you, for example, the top of a building, an aeroplane or a ship in a harbour. In these cases, the angle of elevation or depression is the angle between the horizontal and the line of sight of the object.

# TIP

Angles of elevation are always measured from the horizontal.

# Drawing a scale diagram

Here are some steps for drawing diagrams to scale:

Draw a rough sketch, showing all details as given in the question.  
- If you are told to use a particular scale you must use it! If you are not given a scale, try to choose one that will make your diagram fit neatly onto a page.  
- Make a clean, tidy and accurate scale drawing using appropriate geometrical instruments. Show on it the given lengths and angles. Write the scale next to the drawing.  
Measure lengths and angles on the drawing to the answer the problem. Remember to change the lengths to full size using the scale. Remember that the full size angles are the same as the angles in the scale drawing.

# MATHEMATICAL CONNECTIONS

A scale drawing is similar to the real object, so the sides are in proportion and corresponding angles are equal. You learned about similar shapes in Chapter 11.

# Exercise 15.2

1 The diagram is a rough sketch of a field  $ABCD$ .

a Using a scale of  $1\mathrm{cm}$  to  $20\mathrm{m}$  make an accurate scale drawing of the field.  
b Find the sizes of angle BCD and angle ADC at the corners of the field.  
c Find the length of the side  $CD$  of the field.

2 A ladder of length  $3.6\mathrm{m}$  stands on horizontal ground and leans against a vertical wall at an angle of  $70^{\circ}$  to the horizontal (see diagram).

a What is the size of the angle that the ladder makes with the wall  $(a)$ ?  
b Draw a scale drawing using a scale of  $1\mathrm{cm}$  to  $50\mathrm{cm}$  to find how far the ladder reaches up the wall  $(b)$

3 The scale diagram represents the vertical wall  $TF$  of a building that stands on horizontal ground. It is drawn to a scale of  $1 \, \text{cm}$  to  $8 \, \text{m}$ .

a Find the height of the building.  
b Find the distance from the point  $A$  to the bottom  $(B)$  of the building.

# REFLECTION

What advice would you give to a student who finds this work difficult?

# 15.2 Bearings

You have now used scale drawings to find distances between objects and to measure angles. When you want to move from one position to another, you not only need to know how far you have to travel but you need to know the direction. One way of describing a direction is the bearing. This description is used around the world.

The angle  $118^{\circ}$ , shown on the right, is measured clockwise from the north direction. Such an angle is called a bearing.

All bearings are measured clockwise from the north direction.

Here the bearing of  $P$  from  $O$  is  $118^{\circ}$

# MATHEMATICAL CONNECTIONS

One degree of bearing does not seem like a lot but it can represent a huge distance in the real world. This is why you need to use the trigonometry you will learn later in this chapter to calculate angles accurately.

If the angle is less than  $100^{\circ}$  you still use three figures so that it is clear that you mean to use a bearing.

Here the bearing of  $Q$  from  $O$  is  $040^{\circ}$

![](images/890adcec4642175ba8e06b822f28de192bba35c014b3325b3e9a51c22bb7ceda.jpg)

Since you always measure clockwise from north it is possible for your bearing to be a reflex angle.

Here the bearing of  $R$  from  $O$  is  $315^{\circ}$

![](images/ae178104012a0cb24026557ebd03a2048dfd5760ace3f6741e73c16c9f5772f3.jpg)

# MATHEMATICAL CONNECTIONS

You saw in Chapter 3 that a reflex angle is  $>180^{\circ}$  but  $< 360^{\circ}$ .

You may sometimes need to use angle properties from previous chapters to solve bearings problems.

# WORKED EXAMPLE 2

The bearing of town B from city A is  $048^{\circ}$ . What is the bearing of city A from town B?

![](images/a39e90c679814ee601ab883990b84ae98a66fd25b013bf41cbf7550b0b380a68.jpg)

# Answer

In the second diagram, the two north lines are parallel. Hence angle  $\theta = 48^{\circ}$  (using the properties of corresponding angles).

The bearing of city A from town  $B = 48^{\circ} + 180^{\circ} = 228^{\circ}$

Notice that the difference between the two bearings  $(48^{\circ}$  and  $228^{\circ})$  is  $180^{\circ}$

# TIP

Always make sure that you draw a clear diagram and mark all north lines clearly. Bearings should always be measured from north.

# TIP

This is an example of a 'back' bearing. If you know the bearing of point  $X$  from point  $Y$  then, to find the bearing to return to point  $Y$  from point  $X$ , you add  $180^\circ$  to the original bearing (or subtract  $180^\circ$  if adding would give a value greater than  $360^\circ$ ).

# MATHEMATICAL CONNECTIONS

You should remind yourself how to deal with alternate and corresponding angles from Chapter 3.

# Exercise 15.3

1 Give the three-figure bearing corresponding to:

a west

b south-east

c north-east.

2 Write down the three figure bearings of  $A$  from  $B$  for each of the following:

the direct distance from Becton to Townsville.

b the bearing of village  $Q$  from village  $R$

# 15.3 Understanding the tangent, cosine and sine ratios

In trigonometry you will use ratios of side lengths in a right-angled triangle to calculate angles or the lengths of other sides. The techniques covered in the following sections will help you to make much more precise calculations with bearings.

Throughout the remainder of this chapter you must make sure that your calculator is set in degrees mode. A small letter  $D$  will usually be displayed. If this is not the case, or if your calculator displays a  $G$  or an  $R$ , then please consult your calculator manual.

# Labelling the sides of a right-angled triangle

You already know that the longest side of a right-angled triangle is called the hypotenuse. If you take one of the two non right-angles in the triangle for reference then you can also 'name' the two shorter sides:

![](images/d030d2ea9fe595dc3680a60b10959f84cf6e4cc4e16d2834949e805800e837b7.jpg)

Notice that the adjacent is the side of the triangle that touches the angle  $A$ , but is not the hypotenuse. The third side does not meet with angle  $A$  at all and is known as the opposite. Throughout the remainder of the chapter, we will use  $\mathrm{opp}(A)$  to mean the length of the opposite side, and  $\mathrm{adj}(A)$  to mean the length of the adjacent. The hypotenuse does not depend upon the position of angle  $A$ , so is just written as 'hypotenuse' (or hyp).

# Exercise 15.4

1 For each of the following triangles write down the letters that correspond to the length of the hypotenuse and the values of  $\mathrm{opp}(A)$  and  $\mathrm{adj}(A)$ .

# INVESTIGATION

Lengths and angles in triangles

You will now explore the relationship between the opposite, adjacent and hypotenuse and the angles in a right-angled triangle.

For this investigation, draw four different scale copies of this diagram. Draw the angles as accurately as possible, and all four triangles should be different sizes.

![](images/fc9906d94185b5844ab3cb6c1e4cd4fd384fe8ea6d29ea5d6e728983f77dd48a.jpg)

1 Label opp(30°), adj(30°) and hypotenuse clearly.  
2 Measure the length of opp(30°) and write it down.  
3 Measure the length of adj(30°) and write it down.  
4 Calculate  $\frac{\mathrm{opp}(30^{\circ})}{\mathrm{adj}(30^{\circ})}$  in each case.  
5 What do you notice about your answers?  
6 Compare your answers with those of a partner. What do you notice?  
7 Now repeat the investigation using another right-angled triangle with different angles. Write down any observations that you make.  
8 Does the same happen if you divide another pair of sides for each triangle?

# Tangent ratio

It turns out that  $\frac{\mathrm{opp}(A)}{\mathrm{adj}(A)}$  is constant for any given angle  $A$ .  $\frac{\mathrm{opp}(A)}{\mathrm{adj}(A)}$  depends on the angle only, and not the actual size of the triangle. The ratio  $\frac{\mathrm{opp}(A)}{\mathrm{adj}(A)}$  is called the tangent ratio and you write:

$$
\tan A = \frac {\operatorname {o p p} (A)}{\operatorname {a d j} (A)}
$$

# MATHEMATICAL CONNECTIONS

You will need to use the skills you learnt for constructing accurate drawings of triangles in Chapter 3.

# MATHEMATICAL CONNECTIONS

Look back at the work on calculating gradients in Chapter 10 and compare it with the tangent ratio. What connection do you notice?

Your calculator can work out the tangent ratio for any given angle and you can use this to help work out the lengths of unknown sides of a right-angled triangle.

For example, if you wanted to find the tangent of the angle  $22^{\circ}$  you enter:

![](images/a3d644e300db0af10110e16be6dbb453559a8f356c328cf680b3cf9c2f5bf0a1.jpg)

Notice that the answer has many decimal places. When using this value you must make sure that you don't round your answers too soon.

Now, consider the right-angled triangle shown.

You can find the unknown side,  $x$  cm, by writing down what you know about the tangent ratio:

$$
\begin{array}{l} \tan 2 2 ^ {\circ} = \frac {\operatorname {o p p} (2 2 ^ {\circ})}{\operatorname {a d j} (2 2 ^ {\circ})} = \frac {x}{1 2} \\ \Rightarrow x = 1 2 \tan (2 2 ^ {\circ}) \\ \therefore x = 4. 8 4 8 3 1 4 \dots \\ x \approx 4. 8 \mathrm {c m} (1 \mathrm {d}. \mathrm {p}.) \\ \end{array}
$$

9 A person at the top of a building can see two bus stops (A and B) at ground level. The top of the building is  $60\mathrm{m}$  vertically above ground level. The angle of depression from the top of the building to bus stop A is  $25^{\circ}$  and the angle of depression to bus stop B is  $20^{\circ}$ . Assuming ground level is perpendicular to the building, how far apart are the bus stops?

# Calculating angles

Your calculator can also 'work backwards' to find the unknown angle associated with a particular tangent ratio. You use the inverse tangent function tan on the calculator. Generally this inverse function uses the same key as the tangent ratio, but is placed above. If this is the case you will need to use 2ndF or shift before you press the tan button.

7 The right-angled triangle  $ABC$  has hypotenuse  $AC = 7\mathrm{cm}$  and side  $BC = 3\mathrm{cm}$ . Calculate the length  $AB$  and hence the angle  $ACB$ .

# TIP

Draw a clear diagram.

# Sine and cosine ratios

You will have noticed that the tangent ratio only makes use of the opposite and adjacent sides. What happens if you need to use the hypotenuse? In fact, there are three possible pairs of sides that you could include in a ratio:

- opposite and adjacent (already used with the tangent ratio)  
- opposite and hypotenuse  
or adjacent and hypotenuse.

This means that you need two more ratios:

The sine ratio is written as  $\sin (A) = \frac{\mathrm{opp}(A)}{\mathrm{hyp}}$  
adj(A) the cosine ratio is written as cos(A) = hyp

As with the tangent ratio, you can use the sin and cos keys on your calculator to find the sine and cosine ratios associated with given angles. You can also use the shift or sin and shift or cos 'inverse' functions to find angles.

Before looking at some worked examples you should note that with three possible ratios you need to know how to pick the right one! 'SOHCAHTOA' might help you to remember:

![](images/ecdca446fcae68b41ec50c9f55333798eb5367b74cfa99efe02ad0815881df92.jpg)

The letters 'SOHCAHTOA' can be divided into three triangles of letters, each representing one of the three trigonometric ratios. The first letter in each trio tells you which ratio it represents (sine, cosine or tangent), the second letter (at the top) tells you which side's length goes on the top of the ratio, and the third letter tells you which side's length goes on the bottom.

For example, if a problem involves the opposite and hypotenuse, you simply need to find the triangle of letters that includes 'O' and 'H': SOH.

The 'S' tells you that it is the sine ratio, the 'O' at the top of the triangle sits on top of the fraction, and the lower 'H' sits on the bottom.

The use of 'SOHCAHTOA' is shown clearly in the following worked examples. The tangent ratio has been included again in these examples to help show you how to decide which ratio should be used.

# TIP

S = sine  
$0 =$  opposite  
H = hypotenuse  
C = cosine  
A = adjacent  
T = tan

a In the diagram, AC is the hypotenuse of the right-angled triangle ABC. AB is the distance that the ladder reaches up the wall.

$$
\begin{array}{l} \mathrm {o p p} (7 0 ^ {\circ}) = A B \\ \mathrm {h y p} = 4. 8 \mathrm {m} \\ \mathrm {S o} \sin 7 0 ^ {\circ} = \frac {\mathrm {o p p} (7 0 ^ {\circ})}{\mathrm {h y p}} = \frac {A B}{4 . 8} \\ \Rightarrow A B = 4. 8 \sin 7 0 ^ {\circ} \\ \Rightarrow A B = 4. 5 \mathrm {m} (1 \mathrm {d}. \mathrm {p}.) \\ \end{array}

# 15.4 Exact trigonometric ratios

You saw in Chapter 3 that some angles arise naturally in familiar shapes. Here are some important examples.

Equilateral triangles contain three  $60^{\circ}$  angles:

![](images/0f0e702033fba0698dd3d5de76597eb06eeb1bcc9ba0a75e656874f1e1f12e07.jpg)

$$
\begin{array}{l} x + x + x = 1 8 0 ^ {\circ} \\ \Rightarrow \quad 3 x = 1 8 0 ^ {\circ} \\ x = \frac {1 8 0 ^ {\circ}}{3} = 6 0 ^ {\circ} \\ \end{array}
$$

Isosceles right-angled triangles contain one  $90^{\circ}$  angle and two  $45^{\circ}$  angles:

![](images/80f8504ba4bea521a935fe2317849a3320d796555bffca37f8f7c5039aa67a8e.jpg)

$$
\begin{array}{l} y + y + 9 0 ^ {\circ} = 1 8 0 ^ {\circ} \\ \Rightarrow \quad 2 y = 9 0 ^ {\circ} \\ \Rightarrow \quad y = \frac {9 0 ^ {\circ}}{2} = 4 5 ^ {\circ} \\ \end{array}
$$

Think about an isosceles right-angled triangle, where the two shorter sides are both 1 cm long.

![](images/4722e7b8341ea7194e6a70e1eb76ad652e87f91ef40516d4d099713905b48d6f.jpg)

By Pythagoras' theorem:

$$
\begin{array}{l} d ^ {2} = 1 ^ {2} + 1 ^ {2} = 2 \\ \Rightarrow d = \sqrt {2} \\ \end{array}
$$

This means that  $d$  is the exact length of the hypotenuse, which you can now use to find the exact values of some trigonometric ratios:

$$
\sin 4 5 ^ {\circ} = \frac {\text {o p p o s i t e}}{\text {h y p o t e n u s e}} = \frac {1}{\sqrt {2}}
$$

$$
\cos 4 5 ^ {\circ} = \frac {\text {a d j a c e n t}}{\text {h y p o t e n u s e}} = \frac {1}{\sqrt {2}}
$$

$$
\tan 4 5 ^ {\circ} = \frac {\text {o p p o s i t e}}{\text {a d j a c e n t}} = \frac {1}{1} = 1
$$

$$
= \frac {1}{\sqrt {2}} \times \frac {\sqrt {2}}{\sqrt {2}} = \frac {\sqrt {2}}{2}
$$

$$
= \frac {1}{\sqrt {2}} \times \frac {\sqrt {2}}{\sqrt {2}} = \frac {\sqrt {2}}{2}
$$

# MATHEMATICAL CONNECTIONS

You learnt about irrational numbers in Chapter 9. Surds such as  $\sqrt{2}$  and recurring decimals such as  $\frac{2}{3}$  are irrational numbers and cannot be written exactly in decimal form.

When a question asks for an answer in exact form, you need to leave surds in root form and recurring decimals as fractions.

You can also use an equilateral triangle, with side  $2\mathrm{cm}$ , to find exact trigonometric ratios for the sine, cosine and tangent of  $30^{\circ}$  and  $60^{\circ}$ .

![](images/aef8c65fb37f9243a6c64e7d96f3a8714e60de56e10625ab080ae6dbbf7a5242.jpg)

By Pythagoras' theorem:

$$
\begin{array}{l} d ^ {2} + 1 ^ {2} = 2 ^ {2} \\ \Rightarrow d ^ {2} = 4 - 1 = 3 \\ \Rightarrow \quad d = \sqrt {3} \\ \end{array}
$$

If you think about the angle  $60^{\circ}$  shown in the diagram. Side  $CD$  is the opposite,  $BD$  is the adjacent and  $BC$  is the hypotenuse.

$$
\begin{array}{l} \sin 6 0 ^ {\circ} = \frac {\text {o p p o s i t e}}{\text {h y p o t e n u s e}} \\ \cos 6 0 ^ {\circ} = \frac {\text {a d j a c e n t}}{\text {h y p o t e n u s e}} \\ \tan 6 0 ^ {\circ} = \frac {\text {o p p o s i t e}}{\text {a d j a c e n t}} \\ = \frac {\sqrt {3}}{2} \\ = \frac {1}{2} \\ = \frac {\sqrt {3}}{1} = \sqrt {3} \\ \end{array}
$$

If you think about the angle marked  $30^{\circ}$  instead, then  $BD$  becomes the opposite,  $CD$  becomes the adjacent and  $BC$  remains the hypotenuse.

$$
\sin 3 0 ^ {\circ} = \frac {\text {o p p o s i t e}}{\text {h y p o t e n u s e}}
$$

$$
\cos 3 0 ^ {\circ} = \frac {\text {a d j a c e n t}}{\text {h y p o t e n u s e}}
$$

$$
\tan 3 0 ^ {\circ} = \frac {\text {o p p o s i t e}}{\text {a d j a c e n t}} = \frac {1}{\sqrt {3}}
$$

$$
= \frac {1}{2}
$$

$$
= \frac {\sqrt {3}}{2}
$$

$$
= \frac {1}{\sqrt {3}} \times \frac {\sqrt {3}}{\sqrt {3}} = \frac {\sqrt {3}}{3}
$$

It is important to notice that you can write the exact values of fractions involving surds in more than one way. Mathematicians usually prefer to use the version that contains an integer in the denominator.

# Answer

First, find the height of the triangle,  $h$

$$
\begin{array}{l} \tan 6 0 ^ {\circ} = \frac {h}{5} \\ \Rightarrow h = 5 \tan 6 0 ^ {\circ} \\ \end{array}

$h = 5\sqrt{3}\mathrm{cm}$  using the exact value of tan  $60^{\circ}$

$$
\begin{array}{l} \text {A r e a} = \frac {1}{2} \times \text {b a s e} \times \text {h e i g h t} \\ = \frac {1}{2} \times 5 \times 5 \sqrt {3} \\ = \frac {2 5 \sqrt {3}}{2} c m ^ {2} \\ \end{array}

# 15.5 Solving problems using trigonometry

You may need to use more than one trigonometric ratio when you solve problems that involve right-angled triangles. To make it clear which ratio to use and when, you should follow these guidelines.

- If the question does not include a diagram, draw one. Make it clear and large.  
- Identify any right-angled triangles that may be useful to you.  
- Draw each triangle separately and clearly label any sides and angles that you already know.  
- Write down which of the opposite, adjacent and hypotenuse you are going to use, and then use SOHCAHTOA to help you decide which ratio to use.  
Write down the ratio and solve, either for an angle or a side.  
- If you need to use a side or angle that you have calculated for another part of a question, try to use the unrounded value that you have in your calculator memory. This will help to avoid rounding errors later on.

# MATHEMATICAL CONNECTIONS

It will be useful to remind yourself about general angle properties of triangles from Chapter 3.

# Calculating distances

In mathematics, when you are asked to calculate the distance from a point to a line you are expected to find the shortest distance between the point and the line. This distance is equal to the length of a perpendicular from the point to the line.

In this diagram, the distance from  $P$  to the line  $AB$  is 5 units.

![](images/d0ddbc073c580bee42b53247f17b935493e67e844b207858fc4b87bc31298176.jpg)

Any other line from the point to the line creates a right-angled triangle and the line itself becomes the hypotenuse of that triangle. Any hypotenuse must be longer than the perpendicular line, so, all the other distances from  $P$  to the line are longer than 5 units.

There are different ways of working out the distance between a point and a line. The method you choose will depend on the information you are given. For example, if you are asked to find the distance between point  $A$  and line  $BD$  given the information on the diagram on the right, you could draw in the perpendicular and use trigonometry to find the lengths of the other sides of the triangle.

![](images/02b0bba36dc0a24789449323a11bcac7a870e67b6d51fad59d64cdbf1a8e084f.jpg)

# MATHEMATICAL CONNECTIONS

You will use the distance between a point and a line again when you deal with circles in Chapter 19.

Worked example 12 shows you how to use trigonometry to find the distance between point  $A$  and the line  $BD$  and then how to use it to solve the problem given. It also shows you how you can set out the solution to a trigonometry problem.

# WORKED EXAMPLE 12

The diagram shows an isosceles trapezium ABDC. Calculate the area of the trapezium.

![](images/6d97a0203cb561d591845dbce0b9eea2667eb54ea22a26397674b45115fa6678.jpg)

# Answer

The area of a trapezium  $=$  (mean of the parallel sides)  $\times$  (perpendicular distance between them).

In this diagram, perpendiculars have been added to form right-angled triangles so that trigonometry can be used.

![](images/63197ce0899a10e6cefc2e888ed25830739169183f7b06050214e59d0e69a0f7.jpg)

$AC = MN$  and you can find the length of MN if you calculate the lengths of BM and ND.

In triangle  ${ABM}$  ,  $\sin {60}^{ \circ  } = \frac{\operatorname{opp}\left( {60}^{ \circ  }\right) }{\operatorname{hyp}} = \frac{AM}{4.6}$  and  $\cos {60}^{ \circ  } = \frac{\operatorname{adj}\left( {60}^{ \circ  }\right) }{\operatorname{hyp}} = \frac{BM}{4.6}$

Hence,  $AM = 4.6 \times \sin 60^\circ$  and  $BM = 4.6 \times \cos 60^\circ$

$AM = 3.983716\ldots cm$  and  $BM = 2.3cm$

By symmetry,  $ND = BM = 2.3\mathrm{cm}$

and  $\therefore MN = 8.2 - (2.3 + 2.3) = 3.6\mathrm{cm}$

Hence,  $AC = 3.6$  cm and  $AM = CN = 3.983716 \dots$  cm

The area of  $ABDC = \left(\frac{AC + BD}{2}\right)\times AM$

$$
\begin{array}{l} = \left(\frac {3 . 6 + 8 . 2}{2}\right) \times 3. 9 8 3 7 1 6 \dots \mathrm {c m} ^ {2} \\ = 2 3. 5 0 3 9 2 9 \dots \mathrm {c m} ^ {2} \\ \end{array}
$$

Area of ABDC  $= 23.5\mathrm{cm}^2$  (to 3 s.f.)

# TIP

Trigonometry is used to work out lengths and angles when they can't really be measured. For example in navigation, surveying, engineering, construction and even the placement of satellites and receivers.

# WORKED EXAMPLE 13

The span between the towers of Tower Bridge in London is  $76\mathrm{m}$ . When the arms of the bridge are raised to an angle of  $35^{\circ}$ , how wide is the gap between their ends?

![](images/51be1d6858cc0f6ae6353c4032dc1961efaa83fc4c81189e5874d796ac9e3545.jpg)

# Answer

Here is a simplified labelled drawing of the bridge, showing the two halves raised to  $35^{\circ}$ .

![](images/52f5bef079f57fd76fe87cb5e63e5a13da9b07245496a16a4a75c7f1fe2fa40f.jpg)

The gap  $= BD = MN$  and  $MN = AC - (AM + NC)$

The right-angled triangles  $ABM$  and  $CDN$  are congruent, so  $AM = NC$ .

When the two halves are lowered, they must meet in the middle.

$$
\therefore A B = C D = \frac {7 6}{2} = 3 8 m
$$

In triangle ABM, cos  $35^{\circ} = \frac{\text{adj}(35^{\circ})}{\text{hyp}} = \frac{\text{AM}}{38}$

$$
\begin{array}{l} A M = 3 8 \times \cos 3 5 ^ {\circ} \\ = 3 1. 1 2 7 7 \dots m \\ \end{array}
$$

$$
\begin{array}{l} \therefore M N = 7 6 - (3 1. 1 2 7 7 \dots + 3 1. 1 2 7 7 \dots) \\ = 1 3. 7 4 4 \dots m \\ \end{array}
$$

The gap  $BD = 13.7\mathrm{m}$  (to 3 s.f.)

# REFLECTION

Some students find applications of trigonometry confusing and difficult to understand.

Did you find anything in this exercise confusing or difficult? If so, which parts?

Do you draw diagrams to understand the angles and trigonometric ratios? How can this help?

Choose at least one idea in trigonometry that you would you like to understand better. Describe three things you could do to achieve better understanding of this idea.

# 15.6 Sines, cosines and tangents of angles greater than  $90^{\circ}$

You have now seen that we can find the sine, cosine or tangent of an angle in a triangle by using your calculator.

It is possible to find sines, cosines and tangents of angles of any size.

# INVESTIGATION

Relationships between sines, cosines and tangents

Use a calculator to find each of the following:

sin 30° and sin 150°

sin 10° and sin 170°

sin 60° and sin 120°

sin5° and sin175°

What did you notice? What is the relationship between the two angles in each pair?

Now do the same for these pairs:

<table><tr><td>cos30°and cos330°</td><td>tan30°and tan210°</td></tr><tr><td>cos60°and cos300°</td><td>tan60°and tan240°</td></tr><tr><td>cos50°and cos310°</td><td>tan15°and tan195°</td></tr><tr><td>cos15°and cos345°</td><td>tan100and tan280°</td></tr></table>

The pattern is different for each of sine, cosine and tangent.

Try plotting the value of  $\sin \theta$ ,  $\cos \theta$  and  $\tan \theta$  against  $\theta$  for several values of  $\theta$ . You can find a graph plotting website on the internet, using a search.

In the rest of this section you will explore the graphs of  $y = \sin \theta$ ,  $y = \cos \theta$  and  $y = \tan \theta$  in more detail.

# The graph of  $y = \sin \theta$

If you plot several values of  $\sin \theta$  against  $\theta$  you will get the following:

![](images/1351543302a9f2bde0745177ce640f47c87cd58082f74ed69d0c9cab813178c5.jpg)

The graph repeats itself every  $360^{\circ}$  in both the positive and negative directions.

Notice that the section of the graph between 0 and  $180^{\circ}$  has reflection symmetry, with the line of reflection being  $\theta = 90^{\circ}$ . This means that  $\sin \theta = \sin (180^{\circ} - \theta)$ , exactly as you should have seen in the investigation.

It is also very important to notice that the value of  $\sin \theta$  is never larger than 1 nor smaller than  $-1$ .

# MATHEMATICAL CONNECTIONS

sinθ, cosθ and tanθ are actually functions. Functions take input values and give you a numerical output. For example, if you use your calculator to find sin 30° you will get the answer  $\frac{1}{2}$ . Your calculator takes the input 30°, finds the sine of this angle and gives you the output  $\frac{1}{2}$ . You will learn more about functions in Chapter 22.

# The graph of  $y = \cos \theta$

If you plot several values of  $\cos \theta$  against  $\theta$  you will get a similar shape, but the line of symmetry is in a different place:

![](images/b4ffb9e3075a19757d4bf31114115bf72de6d0be91e79cf9e75ebf5f727fd146.jpg)

The graph repeats itself every  $360^{\circ}$  in both the positive and negative directions.

Here the graph is symmetrical from 0 to  $360^{\circ}$ , with the reflection line at  $\theta = 180^{\circ}$ . This means that  $\cos \theta = \cos (360^{\circ} - \theta)$ , again you should have seen this in the investigation. By experimenting with some angles you will also see that  $\cos \theta = -\cos (180^{\circ} - \theta)$

It is also very important to notice that the value of  $\cos \theta$  is never larger than 1 normally smaller than  $-1$ .

# The graph of  $y = \tan \theta$

Finally, if you plot values of  $\tan \theta$  against  $\theta$  you get this graph:

![](images/b08b12ad49132a15eccd888bf16faede9b13344d0f4fd2f8be0c6b1de94219d4.jpg)

The graph approaches the vertical dotted lines, but it never touches nor crosses them.

Notice that this graph has no reflection symmetry, but it does repeat every  $180^{\circ}$ . This means that  $\tan \theta = \tan (180^{\circ} + \theta)$ .

Note that, unlike  $\sin \theta$  and  $\cos \theta$ ,  $\tan \theta$  is not restricted to being less than 1 or greater than -1.

The shapes of these three graphs means that equations involving sine, cosine or tangent will have multiple solutions. The following examples show you how you can find these.

# MATHEMATICAL CONNECTIONS

A line that is approached by a graph in this way is known as an asymptote. You will learn more about asymptotes in Chapter 18.

# WORKED EXAMPLE 14

Which acute angle has the same sine as  $120^{\circ}$ ?

# Answer

$$
\sin (1 8 0 ^ {\circ} - \theta) = \sin \theta
$$

The graph of  $\sin \theta$  gives this relationship.

$$
\sin (1 8 0 ^ {\circ} - 1 2 0 ^ {\circ}) = \sin 1 2 0 ^ {\circ}
$$

Let  $\theta = 120^{\circ}$  and subtract to find another angle with the same sine value.

$$
\sin 6 0 ^ {\circ} = \sin 1 2 0 ^ {\circ}
$$

# WORKED EXAMPLE 15

Express each of the following in terms of another angle between  $0^{\circ}$  and  $180^{\circ}$

a cos100°

b -cos  $35^{\circ}$

# Answers

a cos(180°-0）=-cos0

Start with the general relationship.

$$
\cos (1 8 0 ^ {\circ} - 1 0 0 ^ {\circ}) = - \cos 1 0 0 ^ {\circ}
$$

Let  $\theta = 100^{\circ}$  and subtract.

$$
\cos 8 0 ^ {\circ} = - \cos 1 0 0 ^ {\circ}
$$

So, cos  $100^{\circ} = -\cos 80^{\circ}$

Rearrange to find another value equal to  $\cos 100^{\circ}$

b -cosθ=cos(180°-θ)

$$
- \cos 3 5 ^ {\circ} = \cos 1 4 5 ^ {\circ}
$$

# Answers

a Use your calculator to find one solution:  $\sin^{-1}\left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\right) = 45^{\circ}.$

Now mark  $\theta = 45$  degrees on a sketch of the graph  $y = \sin \theta$  and draw the line  $y = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}$  like this:

![](images/298df332f5ff678efc5e4b54ec8730623990ff16e628b3a1f1c304963cae5fa8.jpg)

Using the symmetry of the graph, you can see that there is another solution at  $\theta = 135^{\circ}$ .

Use your calculator to check that sin  $135^{\circ} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}$ .

Notice that  $135^{\circ} = 180^{\circ} - 45^{\circ}$ . You can use this rule, but drawing a sketch graph always makes it easier to understand why there is a second solution.

# TIP

As well as  $\theta$  other variables can be used to represent the angle. In part (c) of the example,  $x$  is used. You work in exactly the same way whatever variable is used.

# TIP

This only needs to be a sketch and doesn't need to be accurate. It should be just enough for you to see how the symmetry can help.

# WORKED EXAMPLE 16 CONTINUED

b Use your calculator to find one solution:  $\tan^{-1}(3) = 71.6^{\circ}$ . As before, mark this on a sketch of the graph  $y = \tan \theta$  and draw the line  $y = 3$ .

![](images/9910d2ef73831776588efe0b6544e0a64c48e102672b183e6fa95780ddfa66f4.jpg)

You can see that the second solution is  $180^{\circ} + 71.6^{\circ} = 251.6^{\circ}$ . More solutions can be found by adding 180 degrees over and over, but these will all be larger than 360 degrees, so they are not in the range that you want.

c Use your calculator to find one solution:  $\cos^{-1}\left(-\frac{1}{2}\right) = 120^{\circ}$  Draw a sketch and mark the values:

![](images/d745b24b2c6e08cb9fb3e215234dfd809d9fea5c95eb05b79950d802a866690a.jpg)

You can now see that the second solution will be at  $360^{\circ} - 120^{\circ} = 240^{\circ}$ .

# TIP

Note that you only need to sketch the part of the graph for 0 to  $360^{\circ}$  because you are only looking for solutions between these two values of  $\theta$ .

There are more solutions, but in the range 0 to  $360^{\circ}$  the line  $y = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}$  only meets the graph  $y = \sin \theta$  twice.

# 15.7 The sine and cosine rules

The sine and cosine ratios are not only useful for right-angled triangles. To understand the following rules you must first look at the standard way of labelling the angles and sides of a triangle. Look at the triangle shown in the diagram.

Notice that the sides are labelled with lower case letters and the angles are labelled with upper case letters. The side that is placed opposite angle  $A$  is labelled 'a', the side that is placed opposite angle  $B$  is labelled 'b' and so on.

# TIP

Write  $\cos x = y$  and try to factorise.

![](images/559445bf1318aa2819013f534505d226b8922870de780a55b176a5fc8e696956.jpg)

# The sine rule

For the triangle shown on the right, the following are true:

$$
\frac {\sin A}{a} = \frac {\sin B}{b} \text {a n d} \frac {\sin A}{a} = \frac {\sin C}{c} \text {a n d} \frac {\sin B}{b} = \frac {\sin C}{c}
$$

These relationships are usually expressed in one go:

$$
\frac {\sin A}{a} = \frac {\sin B}{b} = \frac {\sin C}{c}
$$

This is the sine rule. This version of the rule, with the sine ratios placed on the tops of the fractions, is normally used to calculate angles.

The formulae can also be turned upside down when you want to calculate lengths:

$$
\frac {a}{\sin A} = \frac {b}{\sin B} = \frac {c}{\sin C}
$$

You should remember that this represents three possible relationships.

Notice that in each case, both the upper and lower case form of each letter is used. This means that each fraction that you use requires an angle and the length of its opposite side.

# TIP

Remember, the sine rule is used when you are dealing with pairs of opposite sides and angles.

# WORKED EXAMPLE 17

In  $\Delta ABC, A = 80^{\circ}, B = 30^{\circ}$  and side  $BC = 15\mathrm{cm}$

Calculate the size of  $C$  and the lengths of the sides  $AB$  and  $AC$ .

![](images/6548fe4d096d3f731ee51cf1b21521c86aaefe0045c504b365b25664011e481c.jpg)

# Answer

To calculate the angle  $C$ , use the fact that the sum of the three angles in a triangle is always  $180^\circ$

$$
S o, C + 8 0 + 3 0 = 1 8 0 \Rightarrow C = 1 8 0 - 3 0 - 8 0 = 7 0 ^ {\circ}
$$

Now think about the side AB. AB is opposite the angle C (forming an 'opposite pair') and side BC is opposite angle A, forming a second 'opposite pair'.

So, write down the version of the sine rule that uses these pairs:

$$
\begin{array}{l} \frac {a}{\sin A} = \frac {c}{\sin C} \Rightarrow \frac {B C}{\sin A} = \frac {A B}{\sin C} \\ \mathrm {S o}, \frac {1 5}{\sin 8 0 ^ {\circ}} = \frac {A B}{\sin 7 0 ^ {\circ}} \Rightarrow A B \frac {1 5}{\sin 8 0 ^ {\circ}} \times \sin 7 0 ^ {\circ} = 1 4. 3 \mathrm {c m} (3 \mathrm {s . f .}) \\ \end{array}
$$

Similarly:

AC forms an opposite pair with angle B, so once again use the pair BC and angle A:

$$
\begin{array}{l} \frac {a}{\sin A} = \frac {b}{\sin B} \Rightarrow \frac {B C}{\sin A} = \frac {A C}{\sin B} \\ \mathrm {S o}, \frac {1 5}{\sin 8 0 ^ {\circ}} = \frac {A C}{\sin 3 0 ^ {\circ}} \Rightarrow A C \frac {1 5}{\sin 8 0 ^ {\circ}} \times \sin 3 0 ^ {\circ} = 7. 6 2 \mathrm {c m} (3 \mathrm {s . f .}) \\ \end{array}
$$

# The ambiguous case of the sine rule

The special properties of the sine function can lead to more than one possible answer.

Worked example 18 demonstrates how this may happen.

# TIP

The word 'ambiguous' means that there is more than one way to interpret the question being asked. Here the ambiguous case arises because there are two possible answers.

# WORKED EXAMPLE 18

In triangle  $DEF,DF = 10cm,EF = 7cm$  and angle  $EDF = 34^{\circ}$

Calculate, to the nearest degree, the possible size of:

a angleDEF

b angle DFE.

![](images/a809e8d58eaf3734c6fdf2133b8dd6fedc85a31c1272e0dc0a47d5cef1c82558.jpg)

# Answers

a Angle DEF is opposite a side of length 10cm. This forms one pair.

Angle EDF is opposite a side of length  $7\mathrm{cm}$  . This forms the second pair.

You are trying to find an angle, so choose the version of the sine rule with the value of sine ratios in the numerators:

$$
\frac {\sin 3 4 ^ {\circ}}{7} = \frac {\sin E}{1 0} \Rightarrow \sin E = 1 0 \times \frac {\sin 3 4 ^ {\circ}}{7}
$$

So, angle  $DEF = \sin^{-1}\left(10 \times \frac{\sin 34^\circ}{7}\right) = 53.0^\circ$

But there is actually a second angle DEF such that  $\sin E = 10 \times \frac{\sin 34^\circ}{7}$ .

You can see this if you consider the sine graph. The values of both  $\sin x$  and  $\cos x$  repeat every  $360^{\circ}$ . This property of both functions is called 'periodicity', i.e., both  $\sin x$  and  $\cos x$  are periodic. The periodicity of the function tells you that the second possible value of angle  $DEF$  is  $180^{\circ} - 53.0^{\circ} = 127.0^{\circ}$ .

Both of these are possible values of angle DEF because there are two ways to draw such a triangle.

![](images/c6159eeed56feb6ad6fbd1f6deb4b168d9cfa34ef456df0bb8b5c014a63ccb26.jpg)

b Of course, the answers to part (a) must lead to two possible answers for part (b).

If angle  $DEF = 127.0^{\circ}$ , then angle  $DFE = 180^{\circ} - 127^{\circ} - 34^{\circ} = 19^{\circ}$  (shown as  $E_{1}$  in the diagram).

If angle  $DEF = 53.0^{\circ}$ , then angle  $DFE = 180^{\circ} - 53^{\circ} - 34^{\circ} = 93^{\circ}$  (shown as  $E_{2}$  in the diagram).

(If you had been asked for the length  $DE$ , there would also have been two possible solutions.)

You must always take care to check that all possible answers have been calculated. Bear this in mind as you work through the following exercise.

# Cosine rule

For the cosine rule, consider a triangle labelled in exactly the same way as that used for the sine rule.

![](images/afcabec114d9ae736bf7300eb1b7def596cba15b3b2bb1cacce22e5f0e21b9ad.jpg)

The cosine rule is stated as a single formula:

$$
a ^ {2} = b ^ {2} + c ^ {2} - 2 b c \cos A
$$

Notice that all three sides are used in the formula, and just one angle. The side whose square is the subject of the formula is opposite the angle used (here  $a$  and  $A$ ). This form of the cosine rule is used to find unknown sides. You can use equivalent versions of the rule to find sides labelled  $b$  or  $c$ :

$$
b ^ {2} = a ^ {2} + c ^ {2} - 2 a c \cos B \quad \text {o r} \quad c ^ {2} = a ^ {2} + b ^ {2} - 2 a b \cos C
$$

Notice, also, that you can rearrange any version of the formula to make the cosine ratio the subject.

This version can be used to calculate angles:

$$
\begin{array}{l} a ^ {2} = b ^ {2} + c ^ {2} - 2 b c \cos A \\ \Rightarrow a ^ {2} + 2 b c \cos A = b ^ {2} + c ^ {2} \\ \Rightarrow 2 b c \cos A = b ^ {2} + c ^ {2} - a ^ {2} \\ \Rightarrow \cos A = \frac {b ^ {2} + c ^ {2} - a ^ {2}}{2 b c} \\ \end{array}
$$

# TIP

Remember, if you know all three sides of a triangle, you can use the cosine rule to find any angle. If you know two sides, and the unknown side is opposite a known angle, then you can use the cosine rule to calculate the unknown side.

# Answer

Notice that  $AC = b$  and you know that  $B = 50^\circ$ .

Use the cosine rule in the form,  $b^{2} = a^{2} + c^{2} - 2ac\cos B$ .

$$
\begin{array}{l} b ^ {2} = 9 ^ {2} + 1 8 ^ {2} - (2 \times 9 \times 1 8 \times \cos 5 0 ^ {\circ}) \\ = 8 1 + 3 2 4 - (2 0 8. 2 6 3 1 \dots) \\ = 1 9 6. 7 3 6 8 \dots \\ \end{array}
$$

$$
\begin{array}{l} \therefore b = \sqrt {1 9 6 . 7 3 6 8 \dots} \\ = 1 4. 0 2 6 2 \dots \\ \end{array}
$$

Length of AC = 14.0cm (to 3 s.f.)

# Answer

$DE = f,$  so use the cosine rule in the form,  $f^2 = d^2 +e^2 -2de\cos F.$

$$
\begin{array}{l} f ^ {2} = 2 5 ^ {2} + 3 4 ^ {2} - (2 \times 2 5 \times 3 4 \times \cos 1 2 0 ^ {\circ}) \\ = 6 2 5 + 1 1 5 6 - (- 8 5 0) \quad \text {(n o i c e t h a t c o s 1 2 0 ^ {\circ} i s n e g a t i v e)} \\ = 6 2 5 + 1 1 5 6 + 8 5 0 \\ = 2 6 3 1 \\ \end{array}
$$

$$
\begin{array}{l} \therefore f = \sqrt {2 6 3 1} \\ = 5 1. 2 9 3 2 \dots \\ \end{array}

# Answers

a  $PQ = r$  , so use the cosine rule in the form,  $r^2 = p^2 +q^2 -2pq\cos R.$

$$
\begin{array}{l} r ^ {2} = 5 ^ {2} + 8 ^ {2} - (2 \times 5 \times 8 \times \cos 1 0 0 ^ {\circ}) \\ = 2 5 + 6 4 - (- 1 3. 8 9 1 8 \dots) \quad \text {(n o i t e t h a t} \cos 1 0 0 ^ {\circ} \text {i s n e g a t e}) \\ = 1 0 2. 8 9 1 8 \dots \\ \end{array}
$$

$$
\begin{array}{l} \therefore r = \sqrt {1 0 2 . 8 9 1 8 \dots} \\ = 1 0. 1 4 3 5 \dots \\ \end{array}
$$

Length of  $PQ = 10.1 \, \text{cm}$  (to 3 s.f.)

# WORKED EXAMPLE 21 CONTINUED

b Now you know the value of  $r$  as well as the value of  $R$ , you can use the sine rule:

$$
\begin{array}{l} \frac {\sin P}{P} = \frac {\sin Q}{q} = \frac {\sin R}{r} \\ \frac {\sin P}{5} = \frac {\sin Q}{8} = \frac {\sin 1 0 0 ^ {\circ}}{1 0 . 1 4 3 5 \dots} \\ \end{array}
$$

Using the first and third fractions, sin  $P = \frac{5 \times \sin 100^{\circ}}{10.1435 \dots} = 0.4853 \dots$

$R$  is obtuse so  $P$  is acute, and  $P = 29.0409\dots$

$$
P = 2 9 ^ {\circ} (\text {t o t h e n e a r e s t d e g r e e})
$$

To find  $Q$  you can use the angle sum of a triangle  $= 180^{\circ}$

$$
Q = 1 8 0 ^ {\circ} - (1 0 0 ^ {\circ} + 2 9 ^ {\circ})
$$

:Q=51°(to the nearest degree)

# WORKED EXAMPLE 22

a Change the subject of the formula  $c^2 = a^2 +b^2 -2ab\cos C$  to cos C.  
b Use your answer to part (a) to find the smallest angle in the triangle which has sides of length  $7\mathrm{m},8\mathrm{m}$  and  $13\mathrm{m}$

# Answers

a  $c^2 = a^2 +b^2 -2ab\cos C$

$$
2 a b \cos C = a ^ {2} + b ^ {2} - c ^ {2}
$$

$$
\cos C = \frac {a ^ {2} + b ^ {2} - c ^ {2}}{2 a b}
$$

b The smallest angle in a triangle is opposite the shortest side. In the given triangle, the smallest angle is opposite the  $7\mathrm{m}$  side. Let this angle be  $C$ .

Then  $c = 7$  and take  $a = 8$  and  $b = 13$ .

Using the result of part (a):

$$
\begin{array}{l} \cos C = \frac {8 ^ {2} + 1 3 ^ {2} - 7 ^ {2}}{2 \times 8 \times 1 3} \\ = \frac {6 4 + 1 6 9 - 4 9}{2 0 8} \\ = \frac {1 8 4}{2 0 8} \\ \end{array}
$$

$$
\begin{array}{l} C = \cos^ {- 1} \frac {1 8 4}{2 0 8} \\ = 2 7. 7 9 5 7 \dots^ {\circ} \\ \end{array}

The smallest angle of the triangle  $= 27.8^{\circ}$  (to 1 d.p.)

# 15.8 Area of a triangle

You already know that the area of a triangle is given by the following formula:

This method can be used if you know both the length of the base and perpendicular height, but if you don't have these values you need to use another method.

You can calculate the area of any triangle by using trigonometry.

![](images/48bbd88870c93cc77bdd602fd11fcaab68260f444d846398a538ad07585fbd7b.jpg)

Look at the triangle  $ABC$  shown in the diagram:

![](images/8d9d06f81c10f56e2ab434d0d5afe5bdb6b7ad9caa8de75fac2a6967cfd3e06b.jpg)

![](images/74822beda80ca88ac3556981a4ea66b20de18f9a61afd7a589cc9475f52c4b30.jpg)

The second copy of the triangle is drawn with a perpendicular height that you don't yet know, but if you draw the right-angled triangle  $BCM$  separately, you can use basic trigonometry to find the value of  $h$ .

![](images/80ab8a5a5417fa8e540a45724870736d6da55fcc4352927cf4986c638f6c969e.jpg)

Now note that  $\mathrm{opp}(C) = h$  and the hypotenuse  $= a$ .

Using the sine ratio:  $\sin C = \frac{h}{a} \Rightarrow h = a \sin C$

This means that you now know the perpendicular height and can use the base length  $b$  to calculate the area:

$$
\begin{array}{l} \text {A r e a} = \frac {1}{2} \times \text {b a s e} \times \text {p e r p e n d i c u l a r h e i g h t} \\ = \frac {1}{2} \times b \times a \sin C \\ \mathrm {A r e a} = \frac {1}{2} a b \sin C \\ \end{array}
$$

In fact you could use any side of the triangle as the base and draw the perpendicular height accordingly. This means that the area can also be calculated with:

$$
\text {A r e a} = \frac {1}{2} a c \sin B \text {o r} \text {A r e a} = \frac {1}{2} b c \sin A
$$

In each case the sides used meet at the angle that has been included.

# 15.9 Trigonometry in three dimensions

You can also use the trigonometry ratios to solve problems in three dimensions. With problems of this kind you must draw and label each triangle as you use it. This will help you to organise your thoughts and keep your solution tidy.

When you work with solids you may need to calculate the angle between an edge, or a diagonal, and one of the faces. This is called the angle between a line and a plane.

Consider a line  $PQ$ , which meets a plane  $ABCD$  at point  $P$ . Through  $P$  draw lines  $PR_1, PR_2, PR_3, \ldots$  in the plane and consider the angles  $QPR_1, QPR_2, QPR_3 \ldots$

![](images/c7767fc7c624640d5f99269af73e00014a1745ba6ae90a5ab02394b9ff5b5973.jpg)

- If  $PQ$  is perpendicular to the plane, all these angles will be right angles.  
If  $PQ$  is not perpendicular to the plane, these angles will vary in size.  
It is the smallest of these angles which is called the angle between the line  $PQ$  and the plane  $ABCD$ .

To identify this angle, do the following:

From  $Q$  draw a perpendicular to the plane. Call the foot of this perpendicular  $R$ .  
The angle between the line  $PO$  and the plane is angle  $OPR$

![](images/eb2fff7ebe1058cc64c0670245b1fec877d793645fb66e945cfefed9e68ffde6.jpg)

$PR$  is called the projection of  $PQ$  on the plane  $ABCD$ .

The following worked example shows how you might work through a problem in three dimensions.

# WORKED EXAMPLE 25

The diagram represents a room which has the shape of a cuboid.  $AB = 6m$ ,  $AD = 4m$  and  $AP = 2m$ . Calculate the angle between the diagonal  $BS$  and the floor  $ABCD$ .

![](images/01b8624892edc56a4eef36f1f6da732987133b4eab18c4c631aacd5796d87ae5.jpg)

# Answer

First identify the angle required.  $B$  is the point where the diagonal BS meets the plane ABCD.

${SD}$  is the perpendicular from  $S$  to the plane  ${ABCD}$  and so  ${DB}$  is the projection of  ${SB}$  onto the plane.

![](images/6c09d83c8d627e9c60e8beb76623f29cdbc7e24b460e60aaec904d34260a6516.jpg)

The angle required is SBD.

You know that triangle SBD has a right angle at  $D$  and that  $SD = 2m$  (equal to AP).

To find angle SBD, you need to know the length of DB or the length of SB. You can find the length of BD by using Pythagoras' theorem in triangle ABD.

![](images/173a4eb2d278fe9060cc346b4bfea54e0629676a78c2de757143ff2159648714.jpg)

$$
\begin{array}{l} B D ^ {2} = 6 ^ {2} + 4 ^ {2} = 3 6 + 1 6 = 5 2 \\ B D = \sqrt {5 2} \\ \end{array}
$$

So, using right-angled triangle SBD:

$$
\tan B = \frac {\operatorname {o p p} (B)}{\operatorname {a d j} (B)} = \frac {S D}{B D} = \frac {2}{\sqrt {5 2}}
$$

Angle SBD = tan-1(2/√52) = 15.5013...

The angle between diagonal BS and the floor  $ABCD = 15.5^{\circ}$  (to 1 d.p.)

# Scatter diagrams and correlation

# IN THIS CHAPTER YOU WILL:

- draw scatter diagrams for bivariate data  
- identify whether or not there is a positive or negative correlation between the two variables  
decide whether a correlation is strong or weak  
draw a line of best fit  
use a line of best fit to make predictions  
- decide how reliable your predictions are  
- recognise the common errors that are often made with scatter diagrams.

Mount Everest, the highest mountain on Earth, stands 8849 metres above mean sea level. Even close to the mountain there are big changes in the height of the land, but other things change too. How does the depth of snow at the top of the mountain compare to the snow cover much further down? Why do you think this happens? How can scientists display data, so that they can predict the depths of snow at different heights?

# GETTING STARTED

You should already be familiar with scatter diagrams and correlation.

<table><tr><td>Positive correlation</td><td>Negative correlation</td><td>Zero correlation</td></tr><tr><td>Points clustered around a &#x27;line&#x27; sloping up to the right.</td><td>Points clustered around a &#x27;line&#x27; sloping down to the right.</td><td>Points are not in a line.</td></tr></table>

1 If you plot the depth of snow against the height above sea level at several places on the slopes of Mount Everest, which of these diagrams is likely to be closest to the graph you draw? Why is the real data not likely to be exactly the same as the diagram you choose?  
2 Think of some other situations where you can compare pairs of measurements using a scatter diagram. Which situations do you think will show positive, negative or zero correlation? Try to find at least three examples of each.  
3 A scientist plots the number of shark attacks on Australian beaches against the profit reported by the top three Australian ice cream manufacturers during each month in 2016, 2017, 2018 and 2019. She finds that there is a strong positive correlation, showing that as ice cream sales increase, so do shark attacks. The scientist concludes that those people who eat ice cream are more likely to be attached by a shark. Explain what might be wrong with this conclusion.

# 16.1 Introduction to bivariate data

In earlier chapters you have seen how to summarise data and draw conclusions based on your calculations. So far the data has been a collection of single measurements, but sometimes you can make more than one calculation in the same situation.

# MATHEMATICAL CONNECTIONS

You learnt how to summarise data and draw conclusions from it in Chapters 4 and 12.

<table><tr><td>KEY WORDS</td></tr><tr><td>bivariate data</td></tr><tr><td>correlation</td></tr><tr><td>dependent variable</td></tr><tr><td>extrapolation</td></tr><tr><td>line of best fit</td></tr><tr><td>negative correlation</td></tr><tr><td>positive correlation</td></tr><tr><td>scatter diagram</td></tr><tr><td>zero correlation</td></tr></table>

Read through this example. A shop sells ice creams throughout the year and the manager wants to look into how sales change as the daily temperature rises or falls. The manager chooses 10 days at random and records both the temperature and the total sales from ice cream for each day. The results are shown in the table:

<table><tr><td>Day</td><td>A</td><td>B</td><td>C</td><td>D</td><td>E</td><td>F</td><td>G</td><td>H</td><td>I</td><td>J</td></tr><tr><td>Temperature (°C)</td><td>4</td><td>18</td><td>12</td><td>32</td><td>21</td><td>-3</td><td>0</td><td>10</td><td>22</td><td>31</td></tr><tr><td>Total sales ($)</td><td>123</td><td>556</td><td>212</td><td>657</td><td>401</td><td>23</td><td>45</td><td>171</td><td>467</td><td>659</td></tr></table>

Notice that two measurements are taken on each day and are recorded as pairs. This type of data is known as bivariate data. You can see this data much more clearly and explore any correlation if you plot the values on a scatter diagram

# Drawing a scatter diagram

When you plot a scatter diagram, the variable you plot on the vertical axis is called the dependent variable. If one variable clearly depends on the other, then use this as your dependent variable. Otherwise, unless you are told what to do, you can choose which way round you plot the variables.

# DISCUSSION

Think about your answers to question 2 in the Getting started activity, where you thought about pairs of variables you could plot on a scatter diagram. For which pairs is there no obvious dependent variable and for which pairs is the dependent variable clear?

# LINK

Correlations are used to investigate possible relationships between variables in many subjects where measurements are taken. For example, a biologist might think about the relationship between the length of a particular bone and the height of a person. Economists may need to consider the relationship between profit and working hours for employees. Geographers can use graphs to investigate any relationship between the heights of cliffs and the maximum gradients of the cliff faces.

In the example of the ice cream shop, it seems sensible that the total sales will depend on the temperature, so plot the sales on the vertical axis.

# TIP

If you are told to plot A against B, then you should plot A on the vertical axis and B on the horizontal axis.

![](images/eddc7df47f19de75ebf5ff9a494e06137c3cfe67cfad2551aaa047f73f5b9af3.jpg)

Notice that there seems to be a relationship between the ice cream sales and the temperature. In fact, the sales rise as the temperature rises. This is called a positive correlation. The trend seems to be that the points roughly run from the bottom left of the diagram to the top right.

If the points been placed from the top left to bottom right you would conclude that the sales decrease as the temperature increases. Under these circumstances you would have a negative correlation. If there is no obvious pattern then you have zero correlation

The clearer the pattern is and the closer the points are to a straight line, the stronger the correlation. These graphs show different 'strengths' of correlation:

![](images/86cb4ab1a013b462bb1ceed81dc18da41f4fd540dcf15d2b39219dcea17d7889.jpg)  
Strong positive

![](images/3d6cb4e6eb2171104381628c47871a6de8eb5063f8359f32f101990842dc75fc.jpg)  
Weak positive

![](images/4757220496ce09c93720237773505bfb91ea12a1faa02317dcb8d18e1892703a.jpg)  
Zero correlation

![](images/3e4614fc43a146f7522b3560f720e022f00a5fa2950a3aeeb1818d6d53772d90.jpg)  
Weak negative

![](images/257f0982700da6869c1a3442433827be08de014e5c21364be17135961fe81424.jpg)  
Strong negative

You should always be ready to state whether a correlation is positive, negative, strong or weak.

Notice on the graph of ice cream sales that one of the results seems to lie outside the general pattern. Unusually high sales were recorded on one day. This may have been a special event or it may have been an error. When you see points like this you should pay attention and investigate them.

# Drawing a line of best fit

You can also show the general trend by drawing a line of best fit. In the diagram a line has been drawn so that it passes as close to as many points as possible.

![](images/13331ba5ddacbe9619d3d10938e9e2b3d68204b9912ea19c421918eaa33a92bb.jpg)  
Scatter diagram showing the relationship between ice cream sales and temperature

This is the line of best fit and you can use it to make predictions based on the collected data.

For example, if you want to try to predict the ice cream sales on a day with a temperature of  $27^{\circ}C$ , you carry out the following steps:

1. Locate  $27^{\circ}C$  on the temperature axis.  
2 Draw a clear line vertically from this point to the line of best fit.  
3 Draw a horizontal line from the point on the line of best fit to the sales axis.  
4 Read the sales value from the graph.

The diagram now looks like this and the estimated value for the sales is approximately $575.

# WORKED EXAMPLE 1

The manager of a shoe shop claims that a person's height can give a very good idea of the length of their foot. To investigate this claim, the manager collects the heights and foot lengths, in cm, of ten people and records the results in a table:

a  
Scatter diagram showing the relationship between heights and foot lengths of people

# TIP

When commenting on correlation, always make sure that you refer back to the original context of the question.

# WORKED EXAMPLE 1 CONTINUED

b This is a strong positive correlation because foot length generally increases with height. We can make good predictions of foot length from someone's height and good predictions of someone's height from their foot length.  
c The line of best fit is drawn on the diagram. The line should extend across the entire data set and there should be approximately equal numbers of points on either side of the line.  
d The appropriate lines are drawn on the diagram. A height of  $164\mathrm{cm}$  corresponds to a foot length of approximately  $26\mathrm{cm}$ .  
e A foot length of  $17\mathrm{cm}$  corresponds to a height of approximately  $132\mathrm{cm}$  
Most points are reasonably close to the line, so the correlation is fairly strong. This means that the line of best fit will allow a good level of accuracy when estimates are made.

# TIP

If you are asked to comment on a prediction that you have made, always keep in mind the strength of the correlation as shown in the diagram. If the correlation is weak you should say that your prediction may not be very reliable.

# Extrapolation

Before you draw and interpret some scatter diagrams for yourself you should be aware that there may be problems with making predictions outside the range of the collected data.

In Worked example 1, the data does not include any heights above  $183.4\mathrm{cm}$ . The trend may not continue or it may look different for greater heights. So, for example, you should not try to predict the foot length for a person of height  $195\mathrm{cm}$  without collecting more data.

The process of extending the line of best fit beyond the collected data is called extrapolation.

# Exercise 16.1

# APPLY YOUR SKILLS

1 What is the correlation shown by each of the following scatter diagrams? In each case you should comment on the strength of correlation.

# Marbles in a box

Consider an imaginary three-dimensional game where two players take it in turn to place different coloured marbles into a box.

The box is made from 27 transparent unit cubes arranged in a 3-by-3-by-3 array.

![](images/8a34944ed11f1d96971f832093358183165691e38d7e55c57782260aca88a0f2.jpg)

The aim of the game is to make a winning row of three of your own marbles. Rows can be horizontal, vertical or diagonal.

This diagram shows the placement of one winning row. The marbles are on three levels and the row is diagonal.

![](images/b90cb8bccd9425c7d9afac1948f0d16e584a3dfaf82fbe02caede20c43350e8c.jpg)

How many different ways are there to make a winning row?

Explain clearly how you got to your answer.

# TIP

Take note that in this diagram the edges of the cubes are not shown, just the placement of the marbles on each level.

# Managing money

# IN THIS CHAPTER YOU WILL:

calculate earnings (wages and salaries) in different situations  
- use and manipulate formulae to calculate simple and compound interest  
- solve problems related to simple and compound interest  
apply what you already know about percentages to work out discounts, profit and loss in everyday contexts  
- use a calculator effectively to perform financial calculations  
- read and interpret financial data provided in tables and charts  
- use exponential growth and decay in relation to finance.

Smartphone technology has changed how many people bank and manage their money as well as how people receive and make payments in everyday life. What banking and money apps do you know of? How do they work? What makes them safe to use?

In a survey, a leading business magazine found that  $63\%$  of adults agreed that financial skills should be taught in schools. Personal financial skills are important for everyone and they become more important as you get older and have to manage your own money. How well (or poorly) you understand the basics of budgeting, saving, debt and investing will affect many aspects of your life. Good financial skills can often be the difference between wealth and poverty.

In this chapter you will apply some of the maths skills you already know to solve finance-related problems. You will use your calculator to find the answers quickly and efficiently.

# 17.1 Earning money

When people are employed they are paid for their work. Earnings can be worked out in different ways:

- Wages - pay based on a fixed number of hours worked, usually paid weekly. Extra hours of work are called overtime and these are usually paid at a higher rate.  
Salary - pay based on a fixed yearly amount, usually paid monthly. Overtime may be paid, or workers may be given time off in exchange for extra time spent at work.  
- Piece work - pay based on the number of items produced.  
- Commission - pay is based on a percentage of sales made; sometimes a low wage, called a retainer, is paid as well as commission.

# WORKED EXAMPLE 1

Emmanuel makes beaded necklaces. He is paid in South African rand at a rate of R24.50 per completed necklace. He is able to make 55 necklaces per week. Calculate his weekly earnings from the sale of necklaces.

# Answer

Earnings  $= 55 \times 24.50$  Multiply items produced by the rate paid.  
$= \mathbb{R}1347.50$

# WORKED EXAMPLE 2

Sanjay works as a sales representative for a company that sells mobile phones in the United Arab Emirates. He is paid a retainer of 800 Dhs (dirhams) per week plus a commission of  $4.5\%$  of all sales.

a How much would he earn in a week if he made no sales?  
b How much would he earn if he sold four phones at 3299 Dhs each in a week?

# Answers

a 800 Dhs

If he made no sales, he would earn no commission, only his retainer.

b Commission  $= 4.5\%$  of  $(3299\times 4)$

Calculate  $4.5\%$  of the total sales Sanjay made.

$= 0.045\times 13196$  
$= 593.82$  Dhs

Earnings  $=$  retainer  $^+$  commission

$= 800\mathrm{Dhs} + 593.82\mathrm{Dhs}$  
$= 1393.82\mathrm{Dhs}$

Add this to the retainer of 800 Dhs.

# MATHEMATICAL CONNECTIONS

You learnt about the decimal equivalents of percentages in Chapter 5.

# WORKED EXAMPLE 3

Josh's hourly rate of pay is \(12.50. He is paid 'time-and-a-half' for work after hours and on Saturdays and 'double-time' for Sundays and Public Holidays.

One week he worked 5.5 hours on Saturday and 3 hours on Sunday. How much overtime pay would he earn?

# Answer

Saturday overtime = 1.5 × $12.50 × 5.5 (time-and-a-half = 1.5 × normal
= $103.13 time)

Saturday overtime  $= 2 \times \$ 12.50 \times 3\) (double-time  $= 2 \times$  normal time)  
 $= \\(75$

Total overtime = $103.13 + $75.00
= $178.13

# Exercise 17.1

# APPLY YOUR SKILLS

1 A waiter earns $8.25 per hour. How much would she earn for a six-hour shift?  
 2 How much would a receptionist earn for working a 35-hour week if the rate of pay is $12.25 per hour?  
3 Calculate the hourly rate for each of the following payments:

a $67.50 for five hours  
b $245.10 for a 38-hour week  
c $126.23 for 13.5 hours  
d $394.88 for five 6½ hour shifts  
e $71.82 for working five hours and 15 minutes.

4 Truck drivers are paid \(15.45 per tonne of wood pulp delivered to a factory in Malaysia. If the drivers deliver 135 tonnes to the factory, how much will they earn?  
 5 A team of workers in a factory is paid $23.25 per pallet of goods produced. If a team of five workers produces 102 pallets in a shift, how much will each person in the team have earned that shift?  
 6 An estate agent is paid a retainer of $150 per week plus a commission on sales. The rate of commission is 2.5% on sales up to $150 000 and 1.75% on amounts above that. How much would she earn in a week if she sold a house for $220 000 and an apartment for $125 000?

# TIP

Commissions like these are on a sliding scale. So if the agent had sales of  $160000, she would be paid 2.5% of$ 150000 and 1.75% of the $10000 that is above this threshold.

# APPLY YOUR SKILLS CONTINUED

7 Here is the time sheet for five workers in a factory. Calculate each person's income for the week if their standard rate of pay is $8.40 per hour.

<table><tr><td>Worker</td><td>Normal hours worked</td><td>Hours overtime at time-and-a-half</td><td>Hours overtime at double-time</td></tr><tr><td>Annie</td><td>35</td><td>2</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Bonnie</td><td>25</td><td>3</td><td>4</td></tr><tr><td>Connie</td><td>30</td><td>1.5</td><td>1.75</td></tr><tr><td>Donny</td><td>40</td><td>0</td><td>4</td></tr><tr><td>Elizabeth</td><td>20</td><td>3.75</td><td>2</td></tr></table>

# Deductions from earnings

Gross income (earnings) is the total amount a person earns.

Deductions, such as income tax, pension contributions, unemployment and health insurance, and union dues are often taken from the gross earnings before the person is paid. The amount that is left over after deductions is called the net income.

Net income  $=$  gross income - deductions

# Exercise 17.2

1 For each person shown in the table:

a calculate their net income  
b calculate their net income as a percentage of their gross income. Give your answers to the nearest whole percent.

<table><tr><td>Employee</td><td>Gross weekly earnings ($)</td><td>Tax ($)</td><td>Other deductions ($)</td></tr><tr><td>B Willis</td><td>675.90</td><td>235.45</td><td>123.45</td></tr><tr><td>M Freeman</td><td>456.50</td><td>245.20</td><td>52.41</td></tr><tr><td>J Malkovich</td><td>1289.00</td><td>527.45</td><td>204.35</td></tr><tr><td>H Mirren</td><td>908.45</td><td>402.12</td><td>123.20</td></tr><tr><td>M Parker</td><td>853.30</td><td>399.10</td><td>90.56</td></tr></table>

# TIP

Gross earnings, deductions and net income are normally shown on a payment advice (slip) which is given to each worker when they get paid.

# Information from tax tables

In most countries, employers deduct taxes from earnings and pay them over to the tax authority. The tax authority publishes a table of tax rates every year so that employers can work out how much tax to deduct. Here is a portion of a tax table:

<table><tr><td>TAXABLE INCOME (in $)</td><td>RATES OF TAX</td></tr><tr><td>0-132 000</td><td>18% of each $1</td></tr><tr><td>132 001-210 000</td><td>$23 760 + 25% of the amount above $132 000</td></tr><tr><td>210 001-290 000</td><td>$43 260 + 30% of the amount above $210 000</td></tr><tr><td>290 001-410 000</td><td>$67 260 + 35% of the amount above $290 000</td></tr><tr><td>410 001-525 000</td><td>$109 260 + 38% of the amount above $410 000</td></tr><tr><td>525 001 and above</td><td>$152 960 + 40% of the amount above $525 000</td></tr></table>

# WORKED EXAMPLE 4

Mr Smit's taxable income is \(153772.00 per annum. How much tax must he pay:

a per year? b per month?

# Answers

a To work out the yearly tax, find his tax bracket on the table. His income is in row two because it is between $132001 and $210000. He has to pay $23760 + 25% of his earnings above $132000.

$$
\begin{array}{l} \$ 153772 - \$ 132000 = \$ 21772 \\ 25 \% \text{of}\\ 21772 = \\ 5443 \\ \end{array}
$$

Tax payable =  $23760 +$ 5443 = $29203 per year

b $29203 ÷ 12 = $2433.58 To find the monthly tax, divide the total from part (a) by 12.

# 17.2 Borrowing and investing money

When you borrow money or you buy things on credit, you are normally charged interest for the use of the money. Similarly, when you save or invest money, you are paid interest by the bank or financial institution in return for allowing them to keep and use your money.

# Simple interest

Simple interest is a fixed percentage of the original amount borrowed or invested. In other words, if you borrow  $100 at an interest rate of \(5\%$  per year, you will be charged \)5 interest for every year of the loan.

Simple interest involves adding the interest amount to the original amount at regular intervals. The formula used to calculate simple interest is:

$$
I = \frac {P R T}{1 0 0}, \text {w h e r e :}
$$

$P =$  the principal, which is the original amount borrowed or saved

$$
R = \text {t h e i n t e r e s t r a t e}
$$

$$
T = \text {t h e t i m e (i n y e a r s)}.
$$

# LINK

In Islam, interest (riba) is forbidden so Islamic banks do not charge interest on loans or pay interest on investments. Instead, Islamic banks charge a fee for services which is fixed at the beginning of the transaction (murabaha). For investments, the bank and its clients share any profits or losses incurred over a given period in proportion to their investment (musharaka). Many banks in Islamic countries have the responsibility of collecting zakat on behalf of the government. Zakat is a religious tax which Muslims who earn above a threshold amount (nisab) are obliged to pay. It is usually calculated at about  $2.5\%$  of yearly personal wealth. Zakat is intended to help the less prosperous and to uplift communities in need.

# WORKED EXAMPLE 5

$500 is invested at 10% per annum simple interest. How much interest is earned in three years?

# Answer

$$
10 \% \text{of}\$ 500 = \frac {10}{100}\times 500 = \$ 50 \quad \text{The interest rate is} 10 \% \text{per annum.}
$$

The interest every year is $50.

So after three years, the interest is:

$$
3 \times \$ 50 = \$ 150 \quad \text {M u l t i p l y b y t h e n u m b e r o f y e a r s}.
$$

# WORKED EXAMPLE 6

Sam invested $400 at 15% per annum for three years. How much money would the investment be worth at the end of the period?

# Answer

At the end of the period he would have  $P + I$  (the principal plus the interest paid).

$$
\begin{array}{l} I = \frac {P R T}{1 0 0} \text {a n d} P = 4 0 0, \text {s o :} \\ P + I = 4 0 0 + \frac {(4 0 0 \times 1 5 \times 3)}{1 0 0} \\ = 1 0 0 + 1 8 0 \\ = \$ 580 \\ \end{array}
$$

# WORKED EXAMPLE 7

How long will it take for $250 invested at the rate of 8% per annum simple interest to grow to $310?

# Answer

Amount = principal + interest

Interest = amount - principal

∴Interest = $310 - $250 = $60

Rate = 8% per annum =  $\frac{8}{100} \times 250 = \$ 20$

So the interest per year is $20.

Total interest  $(60)\div$  annual interest  $(20) = 3$

So it will take three years for  $250 to grow to$ 310 at the rate of 8% per annum simple interest.

# WORKED EXAMPLE 8

Calculate the rate of simple interest if a principal of  $250 grows to$ 400 in three years.

# Answer

Interest paid = $400 - $250 = $150

$$
I = \frac {P R T}{1 0 0}
$$

Change the subject of the formula to  $R$  to find the rate.

$$
1 0 0 I = P R T
$$

$$
R = \frac {1 0 0 I}{P T} = \frac {1 0 0 \times 1 5 0}{2 5 0 \times 3} = 2 0
$$

So, the interest rate = 20%

# TIP

You can manipulate the formula to find any of the values:

$$
I = \frac {P R T}{1 0 0}
$$

$$
P = \frac {1 0 0 J}{R T}
$$

$$
R = \frac {1 0 0 I}{P T}
$$

$$
T = \frac {1 0 0 I}{P R}
$$

# Hire purchase

Many people buy items such as TVs, furniture and cars on a system of payment called hire purchase (HP).

On HP you pay a part of the price as a deposit and the remainder in a certain number of weekly or monthly instalments. Interest is charged on outstanding balances. It is useful to be able to work out what interest rate is being charged on HP as it is not always clearly stated.

# WORKED EXAMPLE 9

The cash price of a car is \(20000. The hire purchase price is \)6000 deposit and instalments of \(700 per month for two years. How much more than the cash price is the hire purchase price?

# Answer

$$
D e p o s i t = \$ 6 0 0 0
$$

$$
\text {O n e i n s t a l m e n t} = \$ 700
$$

24 instalments = $700 × 24 = $16800 (once per month over two years is 24 monthly instalments)

Total HP price  $=$  deposit  $^+$  24 instalments

$$
\begin{array}{l} = \$ 6000 + \$ 16800 \\ = \$ 22 8 0 0 \\ \end{array}
$$

The hire purchase price is $2800 more than the cash price.

# TIP

In HP agreements, the deposit is sometimes called the down-payment.

When interest is calculated as a proportion of the amount owed it is called a flat rate of interest. This is the same as simple interest.

# WORKED EXAMPLE 10

A person bought a car for $30000 on hire purchase. The deposit was 20% and interest on the outstanding balance for the period of repayment is at 10% per annum. If the balance is to be paid in 12 equal instalments, calculate each instalment.

# Answer

Cash price = $30000

Deposit of  $20\% = \frac{20}{100} \times 30000 = \$  6000$

Outstanding balance = $30000 - $6000 = $24000

Interest of  $10\% = \frac{10}{100} \times 24000 = \$  2400$

Amount to be paid by instalments = outstanding balance + interest

$$
\begin{array}{l} = \$ 24000 + \$ 2400 \\ = \$ 26 4 0 0 \\ \end{array}
$$

Each instalment = 26400/12 = $2200 (divide by total number of instalments)

# Compound interest

Simple interest is calculated on the original amount saved or borrowed. It is more common, to earn or to be charged compound interest. With a loan where you are charged compound interest, the interest is added to the amount you owe at regular intervals so the amount you owe increases for the next period. When you invest money for a fixed period, you can earn compound interest. In this case, the interest earned is added to the amount each period and you then earn interest on the amount plus the interest for the next period.

One way of doing compound interest calculations is to view them as a series of simple interest calculations. This method is shown in Worked example 11.

# LINK

When a virus is out of control in a population of animals, it is often true that the number of cases starts to increase by a similar percentage each day. The mathematics that describes this kind of growth is very similar to compound interest. Both start with an initial value – the investment in financial mathematics and the original population in biology – and then a fixed percentage increase occurs at regular intervals.

# WORKED EXAMPLE 11

Priya invested $100 at a rate of 10%, compounded annually. How much is the investment worth after three years?

# Answer

Year 1

$$
I = \frac {P R T}{1 0 0} = \frac {1 0 0 \times 1 0 \times 1}{1 0 0} = \$ 1 0
$$

Use the formula for simple interest.

$$
P + I = \$ 100 + \$ 10 = \$ 110
$$

Year 2

$$
I = \frac {P R T}{1 0 0} = \frac {1 1 0 \times 1 0 \times 1}{1 0 0} = \$ 1 1
$$

P for year 2 is $110; T is one year as you are only finding the interest for year 2.

$$
P + I = 1 1 0 + 1 1 = \$ 1 2 1. 0 0
$$

Year 3

$$
I = \frac {P R T}{1 0 0} = \frac {1 2 1 \times 1 0 \times 1}{1 0 0} = \$ 1 2. 1 0
$$

P for year 3 is $121; T remains one year.

$$
P + I = \$ 133.10
$$

# TIP

When the principal, rate and time are the same, compound interest will be higher than simple interest. The exception is when the interest is only calculated for one period (for example one year), in that case, the compound interest and the simple interest will be the same.

This table and graph compare the value of two $100 investments. The first is invested at 10% simple interest, the second at 10% compound interest.

It is clear that choosing a compound interest rate is to the advantage of the investor. Remember, though, that the same effect is felt with borrowing – the outstanding debt increases each period as the interest is compounded.

You can also calculate compound interest using a multiplier. The calculations in the third column of the table show how this is done.

<table><tr><td>Year (T)</td><td>Total $10% interest compounded annually</td><td>Working using a multiplier</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>110</td><td>100 × 1.1 = 110</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>121</td><td>100 × 1.1 × 1.1 = 121</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>133.10</td><td>100 × 1.1 × 1.1 × 1.1 = 133.10</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>146.41</td><td>100 × (1.1)4 = 146.41</td></tr><tr><td>5</td><td>161.05</td><td>100 × (1.1)5 = 161.05</td></tr><tr><td>6</td><td>177.16</td><td>100 × (1.1)6 = 177.16</td></tr><tr><td>7</td><td>194.87</td><td>100 × (1.1)7 = 194.87</td></tr><tr><td>8</td><td>214.36</td><td>100 × (1.1)8 = 214.36</td></tr><tr><td>9</td><td>235.79</td><td>100 × (1.1)9 = 235.79</td></tr><tr><td>10</td><td>259.37</td><td>100 × (1.1)10 = 259.37</td></tr></table>

- Add the annual interest rate to 100 to get a percentage increase (subtract for a decrease):  $100\% + 10\% = 110\%$  
Express this as a decimal:  $\frac{110}{100} = 1.1$  
- Multiply the principal by a power of the decimal using the number of years as the power. So, for five years:  $100 \times (1.1)^{5}$

You can also insert values into a formula to calculate the value  $(V)$  of an investment when it is subject to compound interest.

$$
V = P \left(1 + \frac {r}{1 0 0}\right) ^ {n}, \text {w h e r e}
$$

$P$  is the amount invested

$r$  is the percentage rate of interest.

$n$  is the number of years of compound interest.

# Exponential growth and decay

When a quantity increases (grows) in a fixed proportion (normally a percentage) at regular intervals, we say that the growth is exponential. Similarly, when the quantity decreases (decays) by a fixed percentage over regular periods of time, it is called exponential decay.

Increasing exponential functions produce curved graphs that slope steeply up to the right. Decreasing exponential functions produce curved graphs that slope steeply down to the right.

Exponential growth and decay can be expressed using formulae.

For growth:  $y = a(1 + r)^n$

For decay:  $y = a(1 - r)^n$

Where  $a$  is the original value or principal,  $r$  is the rate of change expressed as a decimal and  $n$  is the number of time periods.

# MATHEMATICAL CONNECTIONS

When financial investments increase or decrease in value at an exponential rate we talk about appreciation (growth) and depreciation. When the number of individuals in a population increase or decrease exponentially over time, we usually talk about growth or decay.

You will deal with exponential curves in more detail in Chapter 18.

# 17.3 Buying and selling

When people trade, they buy goods, mark them up (decide on a price) and then sell them.

The price the trader pays for goods is called the cost price.

The price the goods are sold at is called the selling price.

If the selling price is higher than the cost price, the goods are sold at a profit.

If the selling price is lower than the cost price, the goods are sold at a loss.

Profit = selling price - cost price

Loss  $=$  cost price - selling price

# Calculating the selling price, cost price and mark up

People who sell goods have to decide how much profit they want to make. In other words, they have to decide by how much they will mark up the cost price to make the selling price.

Cost price + % mark up = selling price

The cost price is always  $100\%$ . If you add  $10\%$  mark up, the selling price will be  $110\%$ .

# WORKED EXAMPLE 18

At a market, a trader makes a profit of  $1.08 on an item selling for$ 6.48.

What is his percentage profit?

# Answer

Cost price = $6.48 - $1.08 = $5.40

Subtract the profit from the selling price to find the cost price of the item.

profit Percentage profit  $=$  cost price  $\times 100$

$$
\begin{array}{l} = \frac {1 . 0 8}{5 . 4 0} \times 1 0 0 \\ = 20\% \\ \end{array}
$$

# WORKED EXAMPLE 19

Find the selling price of an article bought for $400 and sold at a loss of 10%.

# Answer

Cost price = $400

$$
\begin{array}{l} \text{Loss} = 10\% \text{of}\\ \\ \$ 400 \\ = \frac {1 0}{1 0 0} \times 4 0 0 \\ = \$ 40 \\ \end{array}
$$

Selling price  $=$  cost price - loss

$$
\begin{array}{l} = \$ 400 - \$ 40 \\ = \$ 360 \\ \end{array}
$$

# WORKED EXAMPLE 20

A trader sells her product for $39. If her mark up is 30%, what is the cost price of the product?

# Answer

Cost price + mark up = selling price

Selling price  $= 130\%$  of the cost price

So, \( \\( {39} = {130}\%  \times \) selling price

To find  $100\%$

$$
\frac {3 9}{1 3 0} \times 1 0 0 = \$ 3 0
$$

The cost price is $30.

Divide by 130 to find  $1\%$  and then multiply by 100 to find  $100\%$  (which is the cost price).

# Exercise 17.9

1 Find the price that each of each of the following items sold for:

a cost price $130, profit 20%  
b cost price $320, profit 25%  
 cost price $399, loss 15%  
d cost price $750, loss 33 3%.

2 Find the selling price of an article that was bought for $750 and sold at a profit of 12%.  
3 Calculate the selling price of a car bought for $3000 and sold at a profit of 7.5%.  
4 Hakim bought a computer for $500. Two years later he sold it at a loss of 28%. What was his selling price?  
5 An article costing $240 is sold at a loss of 8%. Find the selling price.  
 Kwame makes jewellery and sells it to her friends. Her costs to make ten rings are $377. She wants to sell them and make a 15% profit. What should she charge?  
 7 Tim sells burgers for $6.50 and makes a profit of $1.43 on each one. What is his percentage profit on cost price?

# APPLY YOUR SKILLS

8 VAT at a rate of  $17\%$  is added each time an item is sold on. The original cost of an item is  $\$ 112.00$ . The item is sold to a wholesaler, who sells it on to a retailer. The retailer sells it to the public.

a How much tax will the item have incurred?  
b Express the tax as a percentage of the original price.

# Discount

If items are not being sold as quickly as a shop would like or if they want to clear a stock as new fashions come out, then goods may be sold at a discount

Discount can be treated in the same way as percentage change (loss) as long as you remember that the percentage change is always calculated as a percentage of the original amount.

# WORKED EXAMPLE 21

During a sale, a shop offers a discount of  $15\%$  on a pair of jeans originally priced at $75. What is the sale price?

# Answer

Discount = 15% of $75

$$
\begin{array}{l} = \frac {1 5}{1 0 0} \times 7 5 \\ = \$ 11.25 \\ \end{array}
$$

Sale price = original price - discount

$$
\begin{array}{l} = \$ 75 - 1 1. 2 5 \\ = \$ 63.75 \\ \end{array}
$$

You can also work out the price by considering the sale price as a percentage of  $100\%$ .

100 - 15 = 85, so the sale price is 85% of $75:

$$
\frac {8 5}{1 0 0} \times 7 5 = \$ 6 3. 7 5
$$

The Adelie penguins in the photograph are diving off an iceberg into the water. Their height above and below the water can be graphed against time. What would you expect the shape of the graph to look like? Why?

In Chapter 10 you saw that many problems can be represented by linear equations and straight line graphs. Real-life problems, such as those involving area; the path of a moving object; the shape of a bridge or other structure; the growth of bacteria; and variation in speed, can only be solved using non-linear equations. Graphs of non-linear equations are curves.

In this chapter you are going to use tables of values to plot a range of curved graphs. Once you understand the properties of the different graphs, you will use these to sketch the graphs (rather than plotting them). You will also learn how to interpret curved graphs and how to find the approximate solution of equations from graphs.

# 18.1 Review of quadratic graphs (the parabola)

# MATHEMATICAL CONNECTIONS

You have learnt how to use a table of values to draw curved graphs with equations of the form  $y = x^2 \pm a$  in earlier stages of your studies. You are going to revise that work and then learn how to plot quadratic graphs defined by different equations.

In Chapter 10 you learnt that quadratic equations have an  $x^2$  term as their highest power. The simplest quadratic equation for a quadratic graph is  $y = x^2$ .

Here is a table showing the values for  $y = x^2$  from  $-3 \leq x \leq 3$ .

<table><tr><td>x</td><td>-3</td><td>-2</td><td>-1</td><td>0</td><td>1</td><td>2</td><td>3</td></tr><tr><td>y=x2</td><td>9</td><td>4</td><td>1</td><td>0</td><td>1</td><td>4</td><td>9</td></tr></table>

You can use these points to plot and draw a graph just as you did with linear equations. The graph of a quadratic relationship is called a parabola

Here is the table of values for  $y = -x^2$  from  $-3 \leq x \leq 3$ .

<table><tr><td>x</td><td>-3</td><td>-2</td><td>-1</td><td>0</td><td>1</td><td>2</td><td>3</td></tr><tr><td>y=-x2</td><td>-9</td><td>-4</td><td>-1</td><td>0</td><td>-1</td><td>-4</td><td>-9</td></tr></table>

When you plot these points and draw the parabola you can see that the negative sign in front of the  $x^{2}$  has the effect of turning the graph so that it faces downwards.

If the coefficient  $x^2$  of in the equation is positive, the parabola is a 'valley' shaped curve.

If the coefficient of  $x^2$  in the equation is negative, the parabola is a 'hill' shaped curve.

![](images/76b248ec906da158da8e864a4545dd9defca8b33faf9eb2174990898785c2db2.jpg)

# LINK

People working in all kinds of situations draw graphs to help them understand how two variables might be related. For example, an environmentalist in a national park may be interested in seeing graphs for different parks which show the health of plants around visitor facilities plotted against the number of tourists visiting each year.

# The axis of symmetry and the turning point

The axis of symmetry is the line which divides the parabola into two symmetrical halves. In the two graphs on the previous page, the  $y$ -axis  $(x = 0)$  is the axis of symmetry.

The turning point or vertex of the graph is the point at which it changes direction. For both of the graphs,  $y = x^2$  and  $y = -x^2$ , the turning point is at the origin (0, 0).

# TIP

For most graphs, a turning point is a local minimum or maximum value of  $y$ . For a parabola, if the  $x^2$  term is positive the turning point will be a minimum. If the  $x^2$  term is negative, the turning point will be a maximum.

# Exercise 18.1

1 Complete the following tables of values and plot the graphs on the same set of axes. Use values of -8 to 12 on the  $y$ -axis.

<table><tr><td>x</td><td>-3</td><td>-2</td><td>-1</td><td>0</td><td>1</td><td>2</td><td>3</td></tr><tr><td>y=x2+1</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr></table>

<table><tr><td>x</td><td>-3</td><td>-2</td><td>-1</td><td>0</td><td>1</td><td>2</td><td>3</td></tr><tr><td>y=x2+3</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr></table>

<table><tr><td>x</td><td>-3</td><td>-2</td><td>-1</td><td>0</td><td>1</td><td>2</td><td>3</td></tr><tr><td>y=x2-2</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr></table>

<table><tr><td>x</td><td>-3</td><td>-2</td><td>-1</td><td>0</td><td>1</td><td>2</td><td>3</td></tr><tr><td>y=-x2+1</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr></table>

<table><tr><td>x</td><td>-3</td><td>-2</td><td>-1</td><td>0</td><td>1</td><td>2</td><td>3</td></tr><tr><td>y=3-x2</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr></table>

What happens to the graph when the value of the constant term changes?

# LINK

If you throw an object and ignore any air resistance, the path of the object can be described using a quadratic curve. The symmetry and overall shape of the curve makes it possible to work out things like the maximum height and the distance the object will travel horizontally.

# TIP

Remember that if you square a negative number the result will be positive. If using your calculator, place brackets round any negative numbers.

2 Match each of the five parabolas shown here to its equation.

a  $y = 4 - x^{2}$  
b  $y = x^{2} - 4$  
$y = x^{2} + 2$  
d  $y = 2 - x^{2}$  
e  $y = -x^{2} - 2$

# TIP

These equations are all of the form  $y = -x^2 + c$ , where  $c$  is the constant term. The constant term is the  $y$ -intercept of the graph in each case.

# REFLECTION

Students sometimes convince themselves that they understand a concept once they have successfully done a few examples and memorised the processes.

Do you ever do that?

This approach is counter-productive and doesn't help you master key concepts. Explain why, and suggest two things you can do to focus on fully understanding what you are learning.

# Equations of the form  $y = {x}^{2} + {ax} + b$

You can construct a table of values to plot graphs of quadratic equations of the form  $y = x^2 + ax + b$ . For these tables, you usually work out each term on a separate row and then add them to find the value of  $y$ . Read through the two worked examples carefully to make sure you understand this.

# WORKED EXAMPLE 1

Construct a table of values for  $y = x^2 + 2x - 1$  for values  $-4 \leq x \leq 2$ .

Plot the points to draw the graph.

Answer  

<table><tr><td>x</td><td>-4</td><td>-3</td><td>-2</td><td>-1</td><td>0</td><td>1</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td>x²</td><td>16</td><td>9</td><td>4</td><td>1</td><td>0</td><td>1</td><td>4</td></tr><tr><td>2x</td><td>-8</td><td>-6</td><td>-4</td><td>-2</td><td>0</td><td>2</td><td>4</td></tr><tr><td>-1</td><td>-1</td><td>-1</td><td>-1</td><td>-1</td><td>-1</td><td>-1</td><td>-1</td></tr><tr><td>y=x²+2x-1</td><td>7</td><td>2</td><td>-1</td><td>-2</td><td>-1</td><td>2</td><td>7</td></tr></table>

In this table, you work out each term separately.

Add the terms of the equation in each column to get the totals for the last row (the y-values of each point).

To draw the graph:

- plot the points and join them to make a smooth curve  
- label the graph with its equation.

To plot the graph of a quadratic relationship:

complete a table of values (often some of the values will be given).  
- draw the axes with a ruler and label them  
- plot the  $(x, y)$  values from the table of values  
- join the points with a smooth curve.

Parabolas are part of a family of curves called 'conic sections'. These curves include parabolas, hyperbolas and ellipses. You can make each of them by cutting a cone in different directions. The conic sections also describe the possible paths of planets, comets and meteorites in the solar system.

# TIP

Some calculators have an in-built function to create tables of values. These can help you avoid errors provided you use them correctly. However, make sure that you can still do the calculations without the table function.

# Sketching quadratic functions

You can use the characteristics of the parabola to sketch a graph without drawing up a table of values. Your sketch should show the general features of the graph but it does not have to be accurately plotted on graph paper.

# Sketching simple quadratic functions

When the equation is of the form  $y = ax^2$  or  $y = ax^2 + c$ :

- Check the sign of  $a$  to decide whether the graph is  $\cup$  or  $\cap$  shaped. If  $a$  is positive the graph will be  $\cup$  shaped, if  $a$  is negative the graph will be  $\cap$  shaped.  
Find the  $y$  -intercept by making  $x = 0$  in the equation. The coordinates of the  $y$  -intercept are  $(0,c)$  
Calculate the  $x$  -intercepts by substituting  $y = 0$  into the equation. If the graph has no  $x$  -intercepts, you must work out the coordinates of one point on the graph.  
- Mark the values you have worked out on the axis and draw a smooth curve to complete the graph. Remember to label the graph with its equation.

# WORKED EXAMPLE 3

Answer

The coefficient of  $x$  is  $+2$ , so the graph is U shaped.

There is no constant, c, so the y-intercept is 0 and the graph goes through the origin.

When  $y = 0, x = 0$ , so there is only one solution for  $x$  and you need to find a point on the graph.

Using  $x = 1$  substitute into the equation:  $y = 2(1)^2 = 2$  So (1, 2) is a point on the graph.

Sketch and label the graph.

# TIP

Graphs of the form  $y = ax^2 + c$  are symmetrical about the  $y$ -axis and the turning point is on the  $y$ -axis.

# WORKED EXAMPLE 4

Sketch and label the graph of  $y = -x^2 + 4$ .

The coefficient of  $x$  is  $-1$  so the graph is  $\cap$  shaped.

The constant, c is 4, so the y-intercept is (0, 4).

When  $y = 0$

$$
\begin{array}{l} - x ^ {2} + 4 = 0 \\ \Rightarrow x ^ {2} - 4 = 0 \\ \Rightarrow x ^ {2} = 4 \\ \Rightarrow x = \pm \sqrt {4} \\ \end{array}
$$

$$
\text {S o} x = - 2 \text {o r} 2
$$

The x-intercepts are  $(-2,0)$  and  $(2,0)$

Sketch and label the graph.

# Turning points

To find the coordinates of the turning point of a parabola, you need to find the axis of symmetry.

When the equation is in standard form  $y = ax^2 + bx + c$ , you can find the axis of symmetry using  $x = -\frac{b}{2a}$ . This gives the  $x$ -coordinate of the turning point.

You can then find the  $y$ -coordinate of the turning point by substituting the value of  $x$  into the original equation. This  $y$ -value is the minimum or maximum value of the graph.

# TIP

The turning point of a parabola is the minimum or maximum point of the graph. For the graph  $y = ax^2 + bx + c$ , the turning point is a maximum if  $a$  is negative and a minimum if  $a$  is positive.

# Sketching quadratic functions of the form  $y = ax^2 + bx + c$

When the equation is in the standard form  $y = ax^{2} + bx + c$ :

- Identify the shape of the graph. If the  $x^2$  term is positive the graph is  $\cup$  shaped; if the  $x^2$  term is negative, the graph is  $\cap$  shaped.  
Find the  $y$  -intercept by making  $x = 0$  . The coordinates of the  $y$  -intercept are  $(0,c)$  
Calculate the  $x$  -intercepts by substituting  $y = 0$  into the equation and solving for  $x$  . If there is only one intercept then the graph just touches the  $x$  -axis.  
Find the axis of symmetry and the coordinates of the turning point.  
- Use what you know about the shape of the graph and its symmetry to draw a smooth curve. Label the graph.

# WORKED EXAMPLE 5

Sketch the graph of  $y = x^{2} + 2x - 3$ .

# Answer

$x^{2}$  is positive, so the graph is U shaped.

y-intercept  $= (0, - 3)$  Remember that there is only ever one y-intercept.

To find the  $x$ -intercepts make  $y = 0$ , so

$$
x ^ {2} + 2 x - 3 = 0
$$

$$
(x + 3) (x - 1) = 0
$$

$$
x = - 3 \text {o r} x = 1
$$

So,  $(-3,0)$  and  $(1,0)$  are the  $x$ -intercepts.

The axis of symmetry is  $x = -\frac{b}{2a} = -\frac{2}{2(1)} = -1$ .

Substitute  $x = -1$  to find the turning point:  $(-1, -4)$ .

![](images/3426a9d9db41afce38c71de67ccf0b7a1bf06de17ac9bcc89f677b4a7c07ebcb.jpg)

# TIP

The graph is symmetrical about the vertical line halfway between the  $x$ -intercepts. This gives another way to find the line of symmetry. Halfway between  $x = -3$  and  $x = 1$  is  $x = -1$ .

# WORKED EXAMPLE 6

Sketch the graph  $y = -2x^{2} - 4x + 6$ .

# Answer

$a = -2$  so the graph is  $\cap$  shaped.

The  $y$  -intercept  $= (0,6)$

Find the x-intercepts:

$$
\begin{array}{l} - 2 x ^ {2} - 4 x + 6 = 0 \\ x ^ {2} + 2 x - 3 = 0 \\ (x - 1) (x + 3) = 0 \\ x = 1 \text {o r} x = - 3 \\ \end{array}
$$

(1, 0) and  $(-3, 0)$  are the  $x$ -intercepts.

Find the axis of symmetry using  $x = -\frac{b}{2a}$ $x = \frac{4}{2(-2)} = -1$

Substitute  $x = -1$  into the equation to find the  $y$ -coordinate of the turning point.

$$
y = - 2 (- 1) ^ {2} - 4 (- 1) + 6 = 8
$$

The turning point is at  $(-1, 8)$  and is a maximum because a is negative.

Sketch the graph and label all the important features.

Divide both sides by common factor  $-2$

Factorise the trinomial.

Solve for  $x$ .

Remember this is the  $x$  coordinate of the turning point.

# Find the turning point by completing the square

You can find the coordinates of the turning point of a parabola algebraically by completing the square. This involves changing the quadratic equation from the form  $y = ax^2 + bx + c = 0$  to the form  $y = a(x + p)^2 + q$ . In this form, the turning point of a parabola has the coordinates  $(-p, q)$ .

Consider the equation  $y = x^{2} + 4x - 5$ .

You can rewrite this in completed square form as  $y = (x + 2)^2 - 9$ .

Squaring any value gives an answer that is either positive or 0. So, for any value of  $x$ , the smallest possible value of  $(x + 2)^2$  is 0.

This means that the minimum value of  $(x + 2)^2 - 9$  is -9 and that this occurs when  $x = -2$ .

The turning point of the graph  $y = (x + 2)^2 - 9$  has the coordinates  $(-2, -9)$ .

# MATHEMATICAL CONNECTIONS

You learned how to solve quadratic equations by completing the square in Chapter 14. Revise that section now if you've forgotten how to do this.

# WORKED EXAMPLE 7

a Determine the equation of the axis of symmetry and the turning point of  $y = x^2 - 8x + 13$  by completing the square.  
b Sketch the graph.

# Answers

a  $y = x^{2} - 8x + 13$

First complete the square.

$$
y = (x - 4) ^ {2} - 1 6 + 1 3
$$

Half of 8 is four, but

$(x - 4)^2 = x^2 - 8x + 16$  so you have to subtract 16 to keep the equation balanced.

$$
y = (x - 4) ^ {2} - 3
$$

Simplify your solution.

Turning point: (4, -3)

Axis of symmetry:  $x = 4$

b To sketch the graph, you must find the intercepts.

y-intercept = (0,13)

You can read this from the original equation.

To find the  $x$ -intercept(s), let  $y = 0$  and solve.

$$
\begin{array}{l} 0 = (x - 4) ^ {2} - 3 \\ 3 = (x - 4) ^ {2} \\ x - 4 = \pm \sqrt {3} \\ x = \pm \sqrt {3} + 4 \\ x = 5. 7 \text {o r} 2. 3 \\ \end{array}
$$

Sketch the graph and label it.

# 18.2 Drawing reciprocal graphs (the hyperbola)

Equations of the form  $y = \frac{a}{x}$  (where  $a$  is a whole number) are called reciprocal equations. Graphs of reciprocal equations are called hyperbolas. These graphs have a very characteristic shape. Although it is one graph, it consists of two non-connected curves that are mirror images of each other, drawn in opposite quadrants.

Here is a table of values for  $y = \frac{6}{x}$ .

<table><tr><td>x</td><td>-6</td><td>-5</td><td>-4</td><td>-3</td><td>-2</td><td>-1</td><td>1</td><td>2</td><td>3</td><td>4</td><td>5</td><td>6</td></tr><tr><td>y=6/x</td><td>-1</td><td>-1.2</td><td>-1.5</td><td>-2</td><td>-3</td><td>-6</td><td>6</td><td>3</td><td>2</td><td>1.5</td><td>1.2</td><td>1</td></tr></table>

# TIP

Include at least five negative and five positive values in the table of values to draw a hyperbola because it has two separate curves.

When you plot these points, you get this graph.

![](images/4b3b494e1ef14a50e7c26416bc010f2908fea02e7a7170850c22cbc41002b8ca.jpg)

Notice the following about the graph:

- it has two parts which are the same shape and size, but in opposite quadrants  
the curve is symmetrical  
the curve approaches the axes, but it will never touch them  
there is no value of  $y$  for  $x = 0$  and no value of  $x$  for  $y = 0$

An asymptote is a line that a graph approaches but never intersects. When the equation is of the form  $y = \frac{a}{x}$ , the curve approaches both axes and gets closer and closer to them without ever touching them.

For other reciprocal equations, the asymptotes may not be the axes, in these cases, they are normally shown on the graph using dotted lines.

# MATHEMATICAL CONNECTIONS

Reciprocal graphs occur in inverse proportion problems. You will study inverse proportion in Chapter 21.

# WORKED EXAMPLE 8

Construct a table of values and then draw a graph of  $xy = -12$  ( $x \neq 0$ ) for  $-12 \leq x \leq 12$ .

# Answer

$$
x y = - 1 2 \text {i s t h e s a m e a s} y = - \frac {1 2}{x}.
$$

You do not need all 24 points to draw the graph, so work out every second value.

<table><tr><td>x</td><td>-12</td><td>-10</td><td>-8</td><td>-3</td><td>-4</td><td>-2</td><td>2</td><td>4</td><td>6</td><td>8</td><td>10</td><td>12</td></tr><tr><td>y=-12/x</td><td>1</td><td>1.2</td><td>1.5</td><td>4</td><td>3</td><td>6</td><td>-6</td><td>-3</td><td>-2</td><td>-1.5</td><td>-1.2</td><td>-1</td></tr></table>

# TIP

Reciprocal equations have a constant product. If  $y = \frac{6}{x}$  then  $xy = 6$ . There is no value of  $y$  that corresponds with  $x = 0$  because division by 0 is meaningless. Similarly, if  $x$  was 0, then  $xy$  would also be 0 for all values of  $y$  and not 6, as it should be in this example. This is what causes the two parts of the curve to be disconnected.

# WORKED EXAMPLE 8 CONTINUED

Plot the points to draw the graph.

![](images/f2fbf4cb4cd2f476d9f90cc2f55634fea8f22fd8fc7376755456cf2f9eabefdb.jpg)

Notice that the graph of  $xy = -12$  is in the top left and bottom right quadrants.

This is because the value of the constant term (a in the equation  $y = \frac{a}{x}$ ) is negative.

When  $a$  is a positive value, the hyperbola will be in the top right and bottom left quadrants.

# TIP

The quadrants are labelled in an anticlockwise direction. The coordinates of any point in the first quadrant will always be positive.

![](images/91bd600887559e84dc9853cb731cd7490088e838218c894e7d32b25efbc73d36.jpg)

To plot the graph of a reciprocal relationship:

complete a table of values (often some of the values will be given)  
- draw the axes with a ruler and label them  
- plot the  $(x, y)$  values from the table of values  
- join the points with a smooth curve  
write the equation on both parts of the graph.

# Sketching graphs of reciprocal functions

As with the parabola, you can use the features of the hyperbola (reciprocal function) to sketch the graph.

When the equation is in standard form  $y = \frac{a}{x} + q$  ( $x \neq 0$ ) follow these steps to sketch the graph.

Step 1: Identify the shape of the graph.

The value of  $a$  determines where the curves will be on the graph.

If  $a > 0$ , the  $y$ -values are positive for positive  $x$ -values and negative for negative  $x$ .

If  $a < 0$ , the  $y$ -values are negative for positive  $x$ -values and positive for negative  $x$ .

![](images/855c994693324082d3713f6c396ddaa9eb002a310af07dde53499662ffe29b1b.jpg)

![](images/62404bfa4476d02ca573c5d2b00d02cacf1c364805179df7c9cbcb1dfdc7cbfd.jpg)

Step 2: Work out whether the graph intercepts the  $x$ -axis using  $q$ . If  $q \neq 0$ , the graph will have one  $x$ -intercept. Make  $y = 0$  to find the value of the  $x$ -intercept.

$$
0 = \frac {a}{x} + q
$$

$$
\mathrm {S o}, - q = \frac {a}{x}
$$

$$
- q x = a
$$

$$
x = - \frac {a}{q}
$$

Step 3: Determine the asymptotes. One asymptote is the  $y$ -axis (the line  $x = 0$ ). The other is the line  $y = q$ .

Step 4: Using the asymptotes and the  $x$ -intercept, sketch and label the graph.

# TIP

If  $q = 0$ , the  $x$ -axis is the other asymptote.

# 18.3 Using graphs to solve quadratic equations

Suppose you were asked to solve the equation  $x^{2} - 3x - 1 = 0$ .

To do this, you would need to find the value or values of  $x$  that make  $x^2 - 3x - 1$  equal to 0.

You can try to do this by trial and error, but you will find that the value of  $x$  you need is not a whole number (in fact, it lies between the values of 3 and 4).

It is much quicker and easier to draw the graph of the equation  $y = x^{2} - 3x - 1$  and to use that to find a solution to the equation. Here is the graph:

![](images/36d5c139be24d10a660511bd1571d5f6cff99c2cf68ad80d076982a8905dfbaa.jpg)

The solution to the equation is the point (or points) where  $y = 0$ , in other words you are looking for the value of  $x$  where the graph crosses the  $x$ -axis.

If you look at the graph you can see that it crosses the  $x$ -axis in two places. The value of  $x$  at these points is 3.3 and  $-0.3$ .

These two values are sometimes referred to as the roots of the equation  $x^{2} - 3x - 1 = 0$ .

You can use the graph to find the solution of the equation for different values of  $x$ . Work through Worked example 10 carefully to see how to do this.

# WORKED EXAMPLE 10

This is the graph of  $y = x^{2} - 2x - 7$ . Use the graph to solve the following equations.

a  $x^{2} - 2x - 7 = 0$  
b  $x^{2} - 2x - 7 = 3$  
c  $x^{2} - 2x = 1$

![](images/09a1e6042d2ba2986b1a5f17313af3f05109655c195bf752a6b5659a8a3caf45.jpg)

# TIP

Use a sharp pencil. You will be able to correct your work more easily and it will be more accurate when looking at intersections.

# WORKED EXAMPLE 10 CONTINUED

# Answers

a Since this is the graph of  $y = x^{2} - 2x - 7$  simply find the points on the curve that have a  $y$ -coordinate of 0 (i.e. where the curve cuts the  $x$ -axis).

There are two such points marked A and B on the graph.

The  $x$ -coordinates of these points are -1.8 and 3.8, so the solutions of the equation  $x^{2} - 2x - 7 = 0$  are  $x = -1.8$  and  $x = 3.8$ .

b Find the points on the curve that have a  $y$ -coordinate of 3. (Draw in the horizontal line  $y = 3$  to help with this.)

There are two such points, marked  $P$  and  $Q$ , on the graph.

The  $x$ -coordinates of these points are -2.3 and 4.3, so the solutions of the equation  $x^2 - 2x - 7 = 3$  are  $x = -2.3$  and  $x = 4.3$ .

c Rearrange the equation  $x^{2} - 2x = 1$  so that the left-hand side matches the equation of the graph you are using.

Subtracting 7 from both sides gives  $x^{2} - 2x - 7 = 1 - 7$ , that is,  $x^{2} - 2x - 7 = -6$ .

You can now proceed as you did in parts (a) and (b).

Find the points on the curve that have a  $y$ -coordinate of  $-6$ ; they are marked  $S$  and  $T$  on the graph.

The  $x$ -coordinates of these points are -0.4 and 2.4.

The solutions of the equation  $x^{2} - 2x = 1$  are  $x = -0.4$  and  $x = 2.4$

In summary, to solve a quadratic equation graphically:

- read off the  $x$ -coordinates of any points of intersection for the given  $y$ -values  
you may need to rearrange the original equation to do this.

# Exercise 18.5

1 Use this graph of the relationship  $y = x^{2} - x - 2$  to solve the following equations.

a  $x^{2} - x - 2 = 0$  
b  $x^{2} - x - 2 = 6$  
c  $x^{2} - x = 6$

2 a Construct a table of values for  $y = -x^2 - x + 1$  for values  $-3 \leq x \leq 2$ .

4 a Use an interval of  $-2 \leq x \leq 4$  to draw the graph  $y = 4 - x^2 + 2x$ .  
b Use the graph to solve the following equations.  
i  $0 = 4 - x^{2} + 2x$  ii  $0 = -x^{2} + 2x$

5 a Draw the graph of  $y = x^{2} - 2x - 4$  for values of  $x$  from -2 to 4.  
b Use your graph to find approximate solutions to the following equations.

i  $x^{2} - 2x - 4 = 0$  .ii  $x^{2} - 2x - 4 = 3$  iii  $x^{2} - 2x - 4 = -1$

# SELF ASSESSMENT

Develop a set of success criteria to assess your understanding of curved graphs.

1 Draw a table like this one:

<table><tr><td>Success criteria</td><td>Evidence of success</td><td>Improvements</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr></table>

2 Look back at the learning intentions at the start of this chapter. Use these to develop a list of criteria that you can use to decide whether you have met the learning intentions for graphs of quadratic and reciprocal functions. For example:

1 can use a table of values to plot graphs of equations of the form  $y = {x}^{2} + {ax} + b$  .

3 Once you have your list, check your work against the success criteria.

- Place a tick (✓) in the second column if you can find evidence that you have met each one. (You are looking for how your work shows you have achieved the criteria.)  
If you cannot find evidence, write down what you can do to improve in that particular area.

4 Make any improvements that you need to over the next few days and then reassess your work using the same criteria.

# TIP

Success criteria are sometimes called 'what I'm looking for'. Refer back to Chapter 3 for guidance on this type of self assessment.

# 18.4 Simultaneous linear and non-linear equations

As you did with linear equations, you can use graphs to solve a linear and a non-linear equation, or two non-linear equations simultaneously.

# WORKED EXAMPLES11

The graphs of  $y = 2 + x$  and  $y = x^2 - 3x + 4$

have been drawn on the same set of axes.

Use the graphs to find the  $x$ -values of the points of intersection of the line and the curve.

# Answer

The coordinates of the two points of intersection are approximately (0.6, 2.6) and (3.4, 5.4), so the  $x$ -values of the points of intersection are  $x = 0.6$  and  $x = 3.4$ .

# WORKED EXAMPLE 12

The diagram shows the graphs of  $y = \frac{8}{x}$  and  $y = x$  for positive values of  $x$ .

a Use the graph of  $y = \frac{8}{x}$  to solve the equation  $\frac{8}{x} = 5.7$  
b Find a value of  $x$  such that  $\frac{8}{x} = x$

# Answers

a You have to find a point on the curve that has a  $y$  coordinate of 5.7. Draw the line  $y = 5.7$  to help find this it will be where the line cuts the curve.

The point is marked  $A$  on the diagram. Its  $x$ -coordinate is 1.4, so the solution of the equation  $\frac{8}{x} = 5.7$  is  $x = 1.4$ .

b The straight line  $y = x$  crosses the curve  $y = \frac{8}{x}$  at the point  $B$  on the diagram.

Its  $x$ -coordinate is 2.8. Hence, a value of  $x$  such that  $\frac{8}{x} = x$  is 2.8.

![](images/6ddb70b1ddb98dcc98c9be5791cb1962c898bbe0e3a54602afd1facada4632ad.jpg)

# MATHEMATICAL CONNECTIONS

In Chapter 14 you learnt how to use the point of intersection of two straight lines to find the solutions to simultaneous linear equations. Revise that section now if you cannot remember how to do this.

# TIP

You might also be asked for the y-values, so it is important to pair up the correct x-value with the correct y-value. When  $x = 0.6$ ,  $y = 2.6$  and when  $x = 3.4$ ,  $y = 5.4$ .

# Algebraic solutions of simultaneous linear and non-linear equations

As with simultaneous linear equations, you can also use an algebraic method to find the solution of simultaneous linear and non-linear equations.

You can use a substitution method by first rearranging the linear equation to isolate one of the variables and then substituting this into the quadratic equation and solving.

# TIP

You can solve the quadratic equation using any method you like.

# WORKED EXAMPLE 13

Solve simultaneously:

$$
\begin{array}{l} y = 2 x ^ {2} - x + 3 (1) \\ 4 x - 2 y + 1 0 = 0 (2) \\ \end{array}
$$

Answer

$$
\begin{array}{l} 4 x - 2 y + 1 0 = 0 \\ y = 2 x + 5 \tag {3} \\ 2 x + 5 = 2 x ^ {2} - x + 3 \\ 2 x ^ {2} - 3 x - 2 = 0 \\ (2 x + 1) (x - 2) = 0 \\ x = - \frac {1}{2} \text {a n d} x = 2 \\ y = 2 \left(- \frac {1}{2}\right) + 5 = 4 \text {a n d} y = 2 (2) + 5 = 9 \\ \end{array}
$$

So the solutions are:

$$
\begin{array}{l} x = - \frac {1}{2} \text {a n d} y = 4 \text {a n d} \\ x = 2 \text {a n d} y = 9 \\ \end{array}
$$

Rearrange the linear equation to the form  $y = \ldots$

Substitute [3] into [2] by replacing  $y$  by  $2x + 5$

Solve the quadratic equation. This one factorises.

These are the  $x$ -values of the solutions.

Substitute each value of  $x$  into [3] to find the corresponding  $y$ -values.

# WORKED EXAMPLE 14

Find the points of intersection of these graphs by solving the equations algebraically. Give your answers in exact form.

$$
\begin{array}{l} 2 y = 1 0 x - x ^ {2} - 2 (1) \\ x + y = 6 (2) \\ \end{array}
$$

# WORKED EXAMPLE 14 CONTINUED

# Answer

$$
\begin{array}{l} x + y = 6 \\ y = 6 - x \tag {3} \\ 2 (6 - x) = 1 0 x - x ^ {2} - 2 \\ 1 2 - 2 x = 1 0 x - x ^ {2} - 2 \\ x ^ {2} - 1 2 x + 1 4 = 0 \\ x = \frac {1 2 \pm \sqrt {1 2 ^ {2} - 4 (1) (1 4)}}{2 (1)} \\ = \frac {1 2 \pm \sqrt {8 8}}{2} \\ = \frac {1 2 \pm 2 \sqrt {2 2}}{2} \\ \end{array}
$$

$$
\mathrm {S o}, x = 6 + \sqrt {2 2} \text {a n d} x = 6 - \sqrt {2 2}
$$

$$
y = 6 - (6 + \sqrt {2 2}) = - \sqrt {2 2}
$$

$$
a n d y = 6 - (6 - \sqrt {2 2}) = \sqrt {2 2}
$$

The points of intersection are:

$$
(6 + \sqrt {2 2}, - \sqrt {2 2}) \text {a n d} (6 - \sqrt {2 2}, \sqrt {2 2})
$$

Rearrange the linear equation to the form  $y = \ldots$

Substitute [3] into [2].

Use the quadratic formula to find the values of  $x$ .

Find the corresponding  $y$ -values.

Write your answers as pairs of coordinates.

$y - 4 = 2x$  and  $2y = 3x - 3 + x^{2}$

# TIP

If a straight line is a tangent to the quadratic curve, there will be only one pair of solutions because the line and curve meet only at one point.

# 18.5 Other non-linear graphs

So far you have learnt how to construct a table of values and draw three different kinds of graphs:

linear graphs (straight lines of equations of the form  $y = mx + c$ )  
quadratic graphs (parabolas of equations of the form  $y = ax^2 + bx + c$ )  
reciprocal graphs (hyperbolas of equations of the form  $y = \frac{a}{x} + c$ ).

In this section you are going to apply what you already know to plot and draw graphs formed by higher order equations (cubic equations) and graphs formed by equations that have combinations of linear, quadratic, reciprocal and cubic terms.

# TIP

You are expected to deal with equations that have terms with indices that can be any whole number from -2 to 3 as well as  $\frac{1}{2}$  or  $-\frac{1}{2}$ . When you have to work with higher order equations, they will not contain more than three terms.

# Plotting cubic graphs

# MATHEMATICAL CONNECTIONS

In this section you will plot cubic graphs using a table of values. Later in the chapter you will learn how to sketch the graph of a cubic function by using differentiation to find the stationary (turning) points.

A cubic equation has a term with an index of three as the highest power of  $x$ . In other words, one of the terms is  $ax^3$ . For example,  $y = 2x^3$ ,  $y = -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3$  and  $y = 2x^3 - 4x$  are all cubic equations. The simplest cubic equation is  $y = x^3$ .

Cubic equations produce graphs called cubic curves. The graphs you draw will have two main shapes:

If the coefficient of the  $x^3$  term is positive, the graph will take one of these shapes.

![](images/97627cd390538dfc516bb33facb0b29a577136d77d57b61f7cdb636736f8cfa0.jpg)

If the coefficient of the  $x^3$  term is negative, the graph will be take one of these shapes.

Summarise your findings using sketches and notes to explain the key features of the graph and what happens to its shape for different values of  $a$  and  $d$ .

# Using graphs to solve higher order equations

You can use cubic graphs to find approximate solutions to equations. Worked example 17 shows how to do this.

b Plot the points on the axes and draw the curve.

i To solve  $x^{3} - 2x^{2} - 1 = 0$  , find the point(s) on the curve that have a  $y$  -coordinate of 0.

There is only one point (A on the graph).

The  $x$ -coordinate of  $A$  is 2.2, so the approximate solution of  $x^3 - 2x^2 - 1 = 0$  is  $x = 2.2$ .

ii To solve  $x^{3} - 2x^{2} = -1$ , rearrange the equation so that the left-hand side is the same as the equation shown by the graph.

Subtracting 1 from both sides gives  $x^{3} - 2x^{2} - 1 = -2$ .

Now find the point(s) on the curve that have a  $y$ -coordinate of  $-2$ .

There are three points  $(B_{1},B_{2}$  and  $B_{3}$  on the graph).

The  $x$ -coordinates of these points are the solutions of the equation.

So the approximate solutions of  $x^{3} - 2x^{2} = -1$  are  $x = -0.6$ ,  $x = 1$  and  $x = 1.6$ .

iii Rearrange the equation  $x^{3} - 2x^{2} - 5 = 0$  so that you can use the graph of  $y = x^{3} - 2x^{2} - 1$  to solve it.

Adding 4 to both sides of the equation gives  $x^{3} - 2x^{2} - 1 = 4$ .

Find the point(s) on the curve that have a  $y$ -coordinate of 4.

There is only one point (C on the graph).

At  $C$  the  $x$ -coordinate is 2.7.

The approximate solution is, therefore,  $x = 2.7$ .

# TIP

It is not practical to plot points with more than 1 decimal place when you are drawing graphs, so it makes sense to round the values to 1 decimal place.

# Graphs of equations with combinations of terms

When you have to plot graphs of equations with a combination of linear, quadratic, cubic, reciprocal or constant terms you need to construct a table of values with at least eight values of  $x$  to get a good indication of the shape of the graph.

# Exponential graphs

Exponential growth is found in many real-life situations where a quantity increases by a constant percentage in a particular time: population growth and compound interest are both examples of exponential growth.

# MATHEMATICAL CONNECTIONS

You learnt about exponential growth and decay and applied a formula to calculate growth in Chapter 17.

Equations in the general form  $y = a^x$  (where  $a$  is a positive integer) are called exponential equations.

The shape of  $y = a^x$  is a curve which rises rapidly as it moves from left to right; this is exponential growth. As  $x$  becomes more negative, the curve gets closer and closer to the  $x$ -axis but never crosses it. The  $x$ -axis is an asymptote.

![](images/d160b48c938cb6dfefd221383710fe69774137b0fb63bf8a3d426ae932339b43.jpg)

# TIP

An exponential graph of the form  $y = a^x$  will always intersect the  $y$ -axis at the point  $(0, 1)$  because  $a^0 = 1$  for all values of  $a$ .

(You should remember this from the laws of indices.)

The shape of  $y = a^{-x}$  is a curve which falls as it moves from left to right; this is exponential decay. The  $x$ -axis is also an asymptote for  $y = a^{-x}$ . As  $x$  becomes more positive the curve gets closer and closer to the  $x$ -axis.

# MATHEMATICAL CONNECTIONS

Look again at calculating gradients in Chapter 10. Make sure you understand how to do this before moving onto this section.

# 18.6 Finding the gradient of a curve

This simple graph of height against distance shows the route followed by a mountain biker on a trail.

![](images/8be0dda6d8e717b0588135f3e1e44976f1d5a26de3d43490124864ce53d0307a.jpg)

Some parts of the trail have a steep positive gradient, some have a gradual positive gradient, some parts are level and other parts have a negative gradient. It should be clear from this graph, that a curved graph never has a single gradient like a straight line has.

You cannot find the gradient of a whole curve but you can find the gradient of a point on the curve by drawing a tangent to it.

The gradient of a curve at a point is the gradient of the tangent to the curve at that point. Once you have drawn the tangent to a curve, you can work out the gradient of

the tangent just as you would for a straight line (gradient  $= \frac{y - \text{change}}{x - \text{change}}$ ).

Look at the graph to see how this works.  $BC$  is the tangent to the curve at point  $A$

![](images/03bc491e9eaedae654d048b00239a899209857969786a519a5a6170ed135ea37.jpg)

![](images/1bab5de72b97ef703d8d69f1b8dc2ea8a7512be765541ba3de0fcc6232e59d71.jpg)

Use a pencil to draw the tangent.

# TIP

If you extend your tangent, it may touch the curve again at a completely different point, but this is not a problem.

If the tangent is rising from left to right, its gradient is positive. If the tangent is falling from left to right, its gradient is negative.

Upwards = positive

Downwards = negative

# Calculating the gradient of a tangent

Mark two points,  $P$  and  $Q$ , on the tangent. Try to make the horizontal distance between  $P$  and  $Q$  a whole number of units (measured on the  $x$ -axis scale).

Draw a horizontal line through  $P$  and a vertical line through  $Q$  to form a right-angled triangle  $PNQ$ .

![](images/39487794f910e412d1220ae5e4389cba31a2e6275a8025c6d578ecb787dc9f30.jpg)

Gradient of the curve at  $A =$  gradient of the tangent  $PAQ$

distance  $NQ$  (measured on the  $y$ -axis scale) distance  $PN$  (measured on the  $x$ -axis scale)

# TIP

You must measure NQ and PN according to the scales on the y-axis and x-axis respectively. One of the most common mistakes is not doing this!

# Answer

The rate at which the tree was growing when it was four years old is equal to the gradient of the curve at the point where  $x = 4$ .

Draw the tangent at this point (A).

Gradient at  $A = \frac{NQ}{PN} = \frac{22.5}{8} = 2.8$

The tree was growing at a rate of 2.8 metres per year.

Remember, the gradient can be used to determine rates of change.

# 18.7 Derivatives of functions

As well as drawing a tangent, you can calculate the gradient at any point by using the equation of the curve.

# INVESTIGATION

# Gradients of tangents

1 In Exercise 18.10 you considered the gradient of the curve with equation  $y = x^2$  at the points with  $x$ -coordinates 2, -1 and -1.5. You should have noticed that the gradient is twice the value of the  $x$ -coordinate at any given point.

Now use the diagram or a larger copy, to draw tangents at the points (1, 1), (-2, 4), (3, 9) and (-3, 9). Compare the gradient of each tangent to the  $x$ -coordinate of the point you have used. You should notice that the gradients are twice the  $x$ -coordinate in each case.

2 Here is the curve with equation  $y = x^3$ .

![](images/1b450d40b3e92648712887b0942c1015a07413487dd82b13b2ff23574e465c86.jpg)

Copy the graph using tracing paper and draw tangents to find the gradient of the graph at the points (1,1), (2,8) and  $(-1, - 1)$

Copy and complete the table and compare the gradient to the value of  $x^2$  in each case.

<table><tr><td>x-coordinate</td><td>x2</td><td>Gradient of tangent</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>1</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>4</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>-1</td><td>1</td><td></td></tr></table>

What do you notice?

Try some other points on the curve, where the  $x$ -coordinates are not integers. Do you get the same result?

# Differentiation

You should have found that the gradient at any point on the curve  $y = x^2$  is  $2x$ . It is helpful to write this as  $2x^1$  for reasons that you will see shortly.

You should also have found that the gradient at any point on the curve  $y = x^3$  is  $3x^2$ .

$2x$  and  $3x^{2}$  are known as derivatives of functions and the process used to find them is called differentiation

Using the notation  $\frac{\mathrm{dy}}{\mathrm{dx}}$  to stand for the derivative of function:

$$
\begin{array}{l} i f y = x ^ {2} \text {t h e n} \frac {\mathrm {d} y}{\mathrm {d} x} = 2 x ^ {1} \\ i f y = x ^ {3} \text {t h e n} \frac {\mathrm {d} y}{\mathrm {d} x} = 3 x ^ {2} \\ \end{array}
$$

In both cases, to find the derivative of function you multiply the original equation by the power and reduce the power by 1.

If  $y = x^n$  then, differentiating,  $\frac{\mathrm{d}y}{\mathrm{d}x} = nx^{n - 1}$

Sometimes there is already a number in front of the power of  $x$ . When this happens, you still follow the rule and multiply everything by the power before reducing the power by 1.

If  $y = ax^{n}$  then, differentiating,  $\frac{\mathrm{d}y}{\mathrm{d}x} = n \times ax^{n - 1} = anx^{n - 1}$ .

# WORKED EXAMPLE 23

Find  $\frac{dy}{dx}$  for curves with the following equations.

a  $y = x^{7}$

b  $y = x^{8}$

c  $y = 4x^{5}$

d  $y = -6x^{3}$

# Answers

a  $\frac{\mathrm{dy}}{\mathrm{dx}} = 7x^6$

Multiply the expression by the power. Then reduce the power by 1.

dy 8x7 dx

Multiply by 8 and then subtract 1 from the power, 8.

dy 4x(5x4) dx

You need to multiply the whole expression by 5. Then subtract 1 from the power.

$$
= 2 0 x ^ {4}
$$

d  $\frac{\mathrm{dy}}{\mathrm{dx}} = 3\times (-6x^2)$

$$
= - 1 8 x ^ {2}
$$

The rule is the same for positive and negative terms.

# TIP

It was useful to write the power of 1 in the case  $y = x^2$  of to make it easy to see that the power of 2 had been reduced by 1 as the rule suggests.

# TIP

This rule always works for any power of  $x$ , even if it is negative or a fraction.

# WORKED EXAMPLE 24

Find the gradient of the curve with equation  $y = 4x^3$  at the point (2, 32).

# Answer

The derivative of function tells you the gradient at the point where the  $x$ -coordinate is  $x$ . To find the gradient at a particular point, substitute the value of  $x$  into the derivative of function.

$$
\frac {d y}{d x} = 1 2 x ^ {2}
$$

Multiply by the power and subtract 1 from the power.

$$
\frac {d y}{d x} \text {a t} x = 2 \text {i s} 1 2 \times 2 ^ {2} = 4 8
$$

Substitute  $x = 2$  to find the gradient at the point where the  $x$ -coordinate is 2.

The gradient of the curve at the point (2, 32) is 48.

# Exercise 18.11

a  $y = x^4$

e  $y = 12x^{2}$

f  $y = 7x^{7}$

g  $y = -4x^4$

h  $y = 7x^{12}$

i  $y = -16x^{5}$

2 Find the gradient of each of the following curves at the given point.

a  $y = x^{2}$  at the point (3, 9)

b  $y = x^{3}$  at the point (1, 1)

$y = x^4$  at the point (2, 16)

d  $y = 4x^{2}$  at the point  $(-1,4)$

e  $y = -3x^{3}$  at the point (2, -24)

f  $y = -5x^{6}$  at the point  $(-2, - 320)$

3 Find the coordinates of the point at which the curve with equation  $y = 3x^2$  has gradient 18.

# Differentiating sums and differences

The equation of a curve may involve more than one term and you may be asked to differentiate expressions like  $y = x^2 + x^4$  or  $y = 3x^2 - 4x$ .

To do this, you differentiate each term independently.

You can see this by differentiating  $y = 4x^3$  and then rewriting the answer as a sum of separate terms:

$$
\begin{array}{l} y = 4 x ^ {3} \\ \Rightarrow \frac {\mathrm {d} y}{\mathrm {d} x} = 1 2 x ^ {2} \\ \end{array}
$$

You can rewrite  $12x^{2}$  as the sum:

$$
\frac {d y}{d x} = 3 x ^ {2} + 3 x ^ {2} + 3 x ^ {2} + 3 x ^ {2}
$$

Compare this to the original equation, also written as a sum of separate terms:

$$
y = x ^ {3} + x ^ {3} + x ^ {3} + x ^ {3}.
$$

# TIP

Remember that you will need to use the x-coordinate in each case. Look back at Worked example 24 if you need help.

You can see that each term has been differentiated independently.

So we have the rule:

$$
\text {I f} y = a x ^ {m} + b x ^ {n} \text {t h e n} \frac {\mathrm {d} y}{\mathrm {d} x} = a m n ^ {m - 1} + b n x ^ {n - 1}.
$$

You can extend this rule to adding any number of terms together and it also works for subtraction.

# WORKED EXAMPLE 25

a  $y = 4x^{7} + 3x^{6}$

a  $\frac{dy}{dx} = 28x^6 + 18x^5$

Differentiate each term separately then add them together.

Differentiate each term separately and then subtract.

# Exercise 18.12

a  $y = x^4 +x^5$

b  $y = 3x^{3} - 5x^{4}$

d  $y = \frac{1}{3} x^3 -4x^7$

$y = 6x^{5} - \frac{8}{11} x^{4}$

f  $y = -7x^{2} + 3x^{6}$

g  $y = 12x^{3} + \frac{2}{3} x^{8}$

h  $y = -10x^{12} - 8x^{10}$

i  $y = 4x^{2} - 12x^{3} + 5x^{4}$

at  $x = 3$

b  $y =  - 2{x}^{4} + 3{x}^{2}$

at  $x = -2$

$y = 3x^4 +6x^3 -3x^2$

at  $x = -1$

3 Find the coordinates of the point where the curve with equation  $y = 2x^3 + 3x^2$  has gradient 12.

# MATHEMATICAL CONNECTIONS

You may need to revise the different methods for solving quadratic equations that you learnt in Chapter 14.

4 Find the coordinates of the points where the curve with equation  $y = \frac{1}{4} x^4 - \frac{3}{2} x^2$  has gradient zero.

# Special cases

Sometimes the equation of a curve will contain a multiple of  $x$  or a constant term. In the case of a multiple of  $x$  the rule still applies, for example:

$$
y = 5 x = 5 x ^ {1} \Rightarrow \frac {\mathrm {d} y}{\mathrm {d} x} = 5 x ^ {0} = 5
$$

So, if  $y = kx$ , then  $\frac{\mathrm{d}y}{\mathrm{d}x} = k$ .

If your equation involves a constant term, you need to think about what the graph of  $y =$  constant looks like. You know from Chapter 10 that this is a horizontal line and has gradient zero.

So, if  $y =$  constant then  $\frac{\mathrm{dy}}{\mathrm{dx}} = 0$

# WORKED EXAMPLE 26

Find  $\frac{dy}{dx}$  if  $y = (2x + 3)^2$

# Answer

$$
\begin{array}{l} y = (2 x + 3) ^ {2} = (2 x + 3) (2 x + 3) \quad \text {B e g i n b y e x p a n d i n g t h e b r a c k e t s}. \\ = 4 x ^ {2} + 6 x + 6 x + 9 \\ = 4 x ^ {2} + 1 2 x + 9 \\ \end{array}
$$

$$
\begin{array}{l} \frac {d y}{d x} = 8 x + 1 2 + 0 \\ = 8 x + 1 2 \\ \end{array}
$$

Now you can differentiate:  
$4x^{2}$  is differentiated to give  $8x$

# REFLECTION

Did you make any mistakes in this work?

If so, what did you do to review the mistakes and understand what you did wrong?

# Equations of tangents

In Chapter 10 you learnt how to find the equation of a line when you know both its gradient and the coordinates of a point on the line. You can use the same method to find the equation of a tangent to a curve at a specific point.

You can find the gradient of the tangent by differentiating the equation and using the  $x$ -coordinate of the point where the tangent is drawn. You can find a point on the line by using the given  $x$ -coordinate and substituting it into the equation of the curve to find the  $y$ -coordinate.

# TIP

What is the gradient of the  $x$ -axis?

# WORKED EXAMPLE 27

Find the equation of the tangent to the curve with equation  $y = 3x^2 - 4x + 1$  at the point with  $x$ -coordinate 2.

# Answer

$$
\begin{array}{l} \text {I f} x = 2 \text {t h e n :} \\ y = 3 (2) ^ {2} - 4 (2) + 1 \\ = 1 2 - 8 + 1 \\ = 5 \\ \end{array}
$$

Substitute  $x = 2$  into

the equation to find the y-coordinate.

So the tangent passes through the point (2, 5).

$$
\frac {d y}{d x} = 6 x - 4
$$

So the gradient  $= 6(2) - 4 = 8$

The equation will be of the form  $y = 8x + c$ .

Find the gradient of the tangent by differentiation.

Substitute  $x = 2$

You need to find the equation of a line with gradient 8, passing through the point with coordinates (2, 5).

$$
\text {W h e n} x = 2, y = 5, \text {s o}
$$

$$
\begin{array}{l} 5 = 8 \times 2 + c \\ \Rightarrow c = - 1 1 \\ \end{array}
$$

Substitute values for  $x$  and  $y$  and solve for  $c$

So the equation of the tangent is  $y = 8x - 11$ .

# Exercise 18.14

d  $y = 3x^{3} - 2x + 1$  at the point with  $x$  coordinate 1.5  
$y = \frac{1}{4} x^{2} + \frac{1}{5} x$  at the point with  $x$ -coordinate  $\frac{1}{2}$

# LINK

When a tennis player hits a tennis ball it will follow a curved path. The highest point in the motion is a stationary point we call the turning point of the curve.

# Turning points

Earlier in this chapter you learnt that you can use the method of completing the square to find the points at which a quadratic curve is highest or lowest.

You will now learn how use differentiation to do the same thing, and then compare the answer that you get from completing the square.

Think about the curve with equation  $y = x^{2} - 4x + 1$ . The diagram shows the curve with a tangent drawn at the lowest point.

Note that the gradient of the tangent is zero. Any point where the gradient of a quadratic curve is zero is known as a stationary point. If the point is also either a maximum or minimum point then we call it a turning point.

If the gradient of the tangent is zero at this point, then so is  $\frac{\mathrm{dy}}{\mathrm{dx}}$ .

$$
\begin{array}{l} \mathrm {S o}, \frac {\mathrm {d} y}{\mathrm {d} x} = 2 x - 4 \\ = 0 \\ \Rightarrow x = 2 \\ \end{array}
$$

Substitute this  $x$  -value into the original equation to find the coordinates of the turning point:

$$
\begin{array}{l} y = 2 2 - 4 \times 2 + 1 \\ = 4 - 8 + 1 = - 3 \\ \end{array}
$$

You can see that the point  $(2, -3)$  is the lowest point of the graph. The value  $-3$  is known as the minimum value of  $y$ .

If you complete the square to check the answer, you can see that

$$
\begin{array}{l} y = x ^ {2} - 4 x + 1 \\ = (x - 2) ^ {2} - 3 \\ \end{array}
$$

This confirms that the minimum value of  $y$  is -3 and that this occurs when  $x = 2$ , exactly as you found by differentiation.

# MATHEMATICAL CONNECTIONS

Turning points are just one type of stationary point. Another type of stationary point is a point of inflexion (sometimes written as inflection). If you study mathematics beyond Cambridge IGCSE level, you will learn more about these points. You could do some research to find out what a point of inflexion is and what happens to the gradient on either side of a point of inflexion.

# Maximum and minimum points

In the previous example the turning point was the minimum point on the curve. However, sometimes the turning point is a maximum point. You need to be able to tell which is which. There are several methods you can use to do this.

# Using the shape of the graph

It is easy to see which points are maxima (the plural of maximum) and minima if you use the shape of the curve to help you.

In the case of  $y = x^2 - 4x + 1$  the coefficient of  $x^2$  is positive, which means that the curve is U shaped. The turning point must be a minimum as it is lower than the rest of the curve.

![](images/cdb5f9520308669be2da12f8bf62366550b6b91bb34d7ceb79a3947304392898.jpg)

# TIP

Remember that the coefficient of a power of  $x$  is the number that appears in front of it.

If the coefficient of  $x^2$  is negative then the curve is  $\cap$  shaped, and the turning point is now a maximum.

![](images/0c81ea5e0765fdfbf54088d3954f49c969900074eaa61c4c5c82e8521040857c.jpg)

# Finding the gradient either side of the turning point

You can test find the gradient of other points on the graph by substituting different values for  $x$ .

In the case of  $y = x^2 - 4x + 1$ , the gradient is equal to  $\frac{\mathrm{d}y}{\mathrm{d}x} = 2x - 4$  and the turning point is at  $x = 2$ .

Substitute  $x = 1.9$  and  $x = 2.1$  to find the gradient on either side of the turning point:

At  $x = 1.9$ ,  $\frac{\mathrm{dy}}{\mathrm{dx}} = 2 \times 1.9 - 4 = -0.2$ . The curve is sloping downwards.

At  $x = 2.1$ ,  $\frac{\mathrm{dy}}{\mathrm{dx}} = 2 \times 2.1 - 4 = 0.2$ . The curve is sloping upwards.

This shows that the curve is sloping downwards to the left of the turning point and upwards on the right, so the turning point must be a minimum point.

# Using the second derivative

A third method is to differentiate the function a second time. This gives the second derivative and you write this as  $\frac{\mathrm{d}^2y}{\mathrm{d}x^2}$ . The second derivative gives the rate of change of the gradient, so it tells you whether the gradient is increasing or decreasing at any point  $x$ .

If the value of the second derivative at the turning point is:

- positive, the gradient is increasing and the turning point is a minimum point
- negative, the gradient is decreasing and the turning point is a maximum point.

![](images/77eee6b2f6bbe735ff5dd3668869874791d967d1358c89b2d6ef8df8c8f3b51a.jpg)

![](images/65ac94a5704c85b5ee0a86b76e7b9ec8980c3677c3bb9e45cc48d0ffe3bc9a0f.jpg)

For  $y = x^2 - 4x + 1$ , you know that  $\frac{\mathrm{d}y}{\mathrm{d}x} = 2x - 4$  and differentiating a second time gives  $\frac{\mathrm{d}^2y}{\mathrm{d}x^2} = 2$ . This is positive for all values of  $x$ , which means the gradient is always increasing and so the turning point is a minimum point.

# WORKED EXAMPLE 28

Find the coordinates of the two turning points on the curve with equation  $y = 2x^3 - 3x^2 + 1$ .

Explain which point is a maximum and which point is a minimum.

# Answer

First find the turning points by differentiation:

$$
\frac {d y}{d x} = 6 x ^ {2} - 6 x
$$

At a turning point:

$$
\begin{array}{l} 6 x ^ {2} - 6 x = 0 \\ \Rightarrow x ^ {2} - x = 0 \\ \Rightarrow x (x - 1) = 0 \\ \Rightarrow x = 0 \text {o r} x = 1 \\ \end{array}
$$

# WORKED EXAMPLE 28 CONTINUED

When  $x = 0, y = 0 - 0 + 1 = 1$ , so there is a turning point at  $(0,1)$ .

When  $x = 1, y = 2 \times 1^3 - 3 \times 1^2 + 1 = 0$ , so there is a turning point at  $(1,0)$ .

# Method 1 - using the shape of the curve

Now remind yourself what the graph of a cubic equation looks like. There are two possibilities:

![](images/ea998731fb3655ac86cc29d5575aaf0962cf4ba72818e5576e0d085ae28e7a3d.jpg)  
Coefficient of  $x^3$  is positive

![](images/903dfaf0db90d21a9f2a9adc1fd8fffc16acd0d0e87908000ad30bed09375cc0.jpg)  
Coefficient of  $x^3$  is negative

Given that the coefficient of  $x^3$  is positive, the left graph must be the correct one. Notice that the maximum point lies on the left, with a lower  $x$ -coordinate, and the minimum point lies on the right, with the higher  $x$ -coordinate. So (0, 1) is a maximum and (1, 0) is a minimum.

# Method 2 - using the value of the gradient either side of the turning point

For (0, 1) find the gradient at -0.1 and 0.1:

At  $-0.1$ ,  $\frac{dy}{dx} = 6 \times (-0.1)^2 - 6 \times (-0.1) = 0.06 + 0.6 = 0.66$  so the curve slopes upwards.

At  $0.1, \frac{dy}{dx} = 6 \times (0.1)^2 - 6 \times (0.1) = 0.06 - 0.6 = -0.54$  so the curve slopes downwards.

So  $(0,1)$  is a maximum point.

For (1, 0) find the gradient at 0.9 and 1.1:

At  $0.9, \frac{dy}{dx} = 6 \times (0.9)^2 - 6 \times (0.9) = 4.86 - 5.4 = -0.54$  so the curve slopes downwards.

At  $1.1, \frac{dy}{dx} = 6 \times (1.1)^2 - 6 \times (1.1) = 7.26 - 6.6 = 0.66$  so the curve slopes upwards.

So (1, 0) is a minimum point.

# WORKED EXAMPLE 28 CONTINUED

Method 3 - using the second derivative

$$
\begin{array}{l} \frac {d y}{d x} = 6 x ^ {2} - 6 x, \text {s o d i f f e r e n t i a t i n g a s e c o n d t i m e g i v e s} \frac {d ^ {2} y}{d x ^ {2}} = 1 2 x - 6 \\ \text {F o r} (0, 1), \frac {d ^ {2} y}{d x ^ {2}} = 1 2 \times 0 - 6 = - 6 \\ \end{array}
$$

This is negative, so (0, 1) is a maximum point.

$$
F o r (1, 0), \frac {d ^ {2} y}{d x ^ {2}} = 1 2 \times 1 - 6 = 6
$$

This is positive, so (1, 0) is a minimum point.

# Sketching cubic functions

Earlier in this chapter you learnt that you can sketch a parabola if you know certain features of the graph. You can also sketch the graphs of cubic functions of the form  $y = ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d$  if you know the following features:

- The basic shape and orientation of the graph. Cubic graphs have two basic shapes depending on whether  $a > 0$  or  $a < 0$ .  
The  $y$  -intercept. This is determined by substituting  $x = 0$  into the equation.  
The  $x$ -intercepts. When the cubic equation is given in factor form, that is,  $y = (x + a)(x + b)(x + c)$ , you can let  $y = 0$  and solve for  $x$ . A cubic graph may have three, two or one  $x$ -intercepts.  
- The turning point(s) of the graph. To find the turning points of a cubic function you need to use differentiation and work out whether they are maximum or minimum points by considering the shape of the graph.

# Exercise 18.15

1 Find the turning point or points on the following curves and explain whether each point is a maximum or a minimum.

a  $y = x^{2} - 4x + 1$

b  $y = x^{2} + 6x - 4$

c  $y = -x^{2} + 8x - 2$

d  $y = 3x^{2} - 12x + 4$

e  $y = -2x^{2} + 4x - 3$

f  $y = x^{2} + 3x - 1$

g y=-5x²+3x+4

h  $y = x^{3} - 12x - 1$

y=-x³+6x²+3

j  $y = x(x - 4)$

k  $y = (x - 5)(x + 5)$

y=x(2x-3)

m  $y = x(2x^{2} - 21x + 72)$

n  $y = x^{2}(3 - x)$

2 Use the turning points you worked out in question 1 and what you already know about curved graphs to sketch the graphs in parts (m)  $y = x(2x^2 - 21x + 72)$  and (n)  $y = x^2(3 - x)$ .

b Explain why  $x$  must be less than  $0.5\mathrm{m}$  
c Find the value of  $x$  that will give the maximum possible volume of the box.

# LINK

Maxima and minima are used in many situations. For example, if you have a fixed amount of material to make a box and want to maximise the volume, you would make a cubic box. Similarly, if you want a pond with fixed perimeter but with greatest surface area, you would make a circular pond. Both of these things can be calculated using differentiation.

# TIP

Notice that  $h$  has taken the place of  $y$  and  $t$  has taken the place of  $x$ . The method is the same, only the letters have changed.

# MATHEMATICAL CONNECTIONS

You will need to use the quadratic formula or complete the square to solve a quadratic equation in this question. You learnt how to do this in Chapter 14.

# SUMMARY

# Do you know ...?

The graph of a quadratic equation is a recognisable curve called a parabola.

A reciprocal equation is an equation of the form  $y = \frac{a}{x}$  or  $xy = a$ .

The graph of a reciprocal equation is a two-part curve called a hyperbola.

You can use graphs to solve equations by finding the value of  $x$  or  $y$  at different points on the graph.

You can find the solution to simultaneous equations using the points of intersection of two graphs.

Linear, quadratic, cubic and reciprocal terms can occur in the same equation. It is possible to draw graphs of these curves by constructing a table of values and then plotting the points.

An exponential equation has the form  $y = ab^{x} + c$ . These equations produce steep curved graphs.

You can draw a tangent to a curve and use it to find the gradient of the curve at the point where the tangent touches it.

You can differentiate functions to find gradients and stationary (turning) points.

# Chapter 19

# Symmetry

# IN THIS CHAPTER YOU WILL:

- identify line symmetry of two-dimensional shapes  
find the order of rotational symmetry of two-dimensional shapes  
- recognise and use symmetrical properties of triangles, quadrilaterals and circles  
- recognise symmetry properties of prisms and pyramids  
apply symmetry properties of circles to solve problems.

The vaulted ceiling of the building in the photo on the previous page has symmetry. Where is the mirror line on the ceiling? How many other examples of symmetry can you find in the ceiling's features?

Shapes or objects that can be divided into two or more parts which are identical in shape and size are said to be symmetrical. Symmetry is found in both two-dimensional shapes and three-dimensional objects.

Natural objects sometimes look symmetrical but when you examine them closely you can see that the two halves are not identical. If you put a mirror on one half of your own face, you will see this very clearly.

In this chapter you are going to learn more about line symmetry and turning, or rotational, symmetry, in both two-dimensional shapes and three-dimensional objects. You will also explore the symmetry properties of circles and learn how these are used in geometrical proofs.

# GETTING STARTED

1 Explain why this shape has can be said to have symmetry even though it has no mirror line.

# 19.1 Symmetry in two dimensions

There are two types of symmetry in two-dimensional shapes:

.

.

# Line symmetry

If a shape can be folded so that one half fits exactly over the other half, it has line symmetry (also called reflection symmetry).

Triangle A is symmetrical. The dotted line divides it into two identical parts.

![](images/cc44c53522a9ffda416442b81eae2172708a440eba9017d6c445888125b3337e.jpg)  
Triangle A

Triangle B is not symmetrical. You cannot draw a line which will divide it into two identical halves.

![](images/7c1992c72185da4d73ced16b1fbe01fa5c4bebe89d4e0bede5f3e0c20bc47e12.jpg)  
Triangle B

If you place a mirror on the dividing line on shape A, the view in the mirror will be that of the whole triangle. The line is called the line of symmetry or mirror line of the shape.

# LINK

Molecular symmetry is an important concept in chemistry. When a molecule has symmetry, it means that certain parts of it can be interchanged with other parts without changing the identity of the molecule.

For example, if you rotate a water molecule by  $180^{\circ}$  about an axis passing through the central O atom (between the two H atoms) it will look the same as before.

![](images/97bda69c683547e708b22ff6717513c3998bffb11229f1f589f9af2851563d31.jpg)

Knowing the symmetry properties allows chemists to predict or explain the properties of molecules using a branch of mathematics called group theory.

# MATHEMATICAL CONNECTIONS

You will deal with line symmetry on the Cartesian plane when you deal with reflections about a line in Chapter 23.

Shapes can have more than one line of symmetry:

5 Find and draw the badges of five different makes of motor vehicle. Indicate the lines of symmetry on each drawing.

# TIP

Think carefully about how the paper is folded. The diagram shows that it is folded into four.

# Rotational symmetry

A rotation is a turn. If you rotate a shape through  $360^{\circ}$ , keeping its centre point in a fixed position, and it fits onto itself exactly at various positions during the turn, then it has rotational symmetry. The number of times it fits onto itself during a full revolution is its order of rotational symmetry.

# MATHEMATICAL CONNECTIONS

You will deal with rotational symmetry on the Cartesian plane when you deal with rotations in Chapter 23.

The diagram shows that a square fits onto itself four times when it is turned through  $360^{\circ}$ . The dot in the centre of the square is the centre of rotation. This is the point around which it is turning. The star shows the position of one corner of the square as it turns.

![](images/e24e25c22ff93952a9dbc2be4a722372e68dfc771abafc095efcfdf747f75d95.jpg)

The square fits exactly onto itself four times in a rotation, when it has turned through  $90^{\circ}$ ,  $180^{\circ}$ ,  $270^{\circ}$  and  $360^{\circ}$ , so its order of rotational symmetry is 4. Remember it has to turn  $360^{\circ}$  to get back to its original position.

# TIP

If you have to turn the shape through a full  $360^{\circ}$  before it fits onto itself then it does not have rotational symmetry.

# Exercise 19.2

1 State the order of rotational symmetry of each of the following polygons. The dot represents each centre of rotation.

# 19.2 Symmetry in three dimensions

There are two types of symmetry in three-dimensional shapes:

plane symmetry  
rotational symmetry.

# Plane symmetry

A plane is a flat surface. If you can cut a solid in half along a plane so that each half is the mirror image of the other, then the solid has plane symmetry.

This diagram of a cuboid shows that it can be cut three different ways to make two identical halves.

![](images/89c692331485c8e2bf73fee637ba8bdd5097e877ea756856bd614882e0dd84a2.jpg)

The shaded area on each diagram represents the plane of symmetry (this is where you would cut it).

Can you see that a sphere technically has an infinite number of planes of symmetry? It is symmetrical about any plane that passes through its centre.

# Rotational symmetry

Imagine a rod through a solid shape. The rod forms an axis for the shape to turn around. If you rotate the shape around the axis and it looks the same at different points on its rotation, then the shape has rotational symmetry. The rod is then the axis of symmetry

# 19.3 Symmetry properties of circles

A circle has line symmetry about any diameter and it has rotational symmetry about its centre. From these facts a number of results can be deduced:

1 The perpendicular bisector of a chord passes through the centre.  
2 Equal chords are equidistant from the centre, and chords equidistant from the centre are equal in length.  
3 Two tangents drawn to a circle from the same point outside the circle are equal in length.

# LINK

The Earth rotates about an axis of symmetry. Where the Earth's axis meets the Earth's surface you will find the Geographical North and South Poles.

# MATHEMATICAL CONNECTIONS

Make sure you remember the correct names of circle parts.

These were covered in Chapter 3 and revised in the Getting started activities in this chapter.

The perpendicular bisector of a chord passes through the centre

The perpendicular bisector of chord  $AB$  is the locus of points equidistant from  $A$  and  $B$ .

But centre  $O$  is equidistant from  $A$  and  $B$  (OA and OB are radii of circle with centre  $O$ ).

...  $O$  must be on the perpendicular bisector of  $AB$ .

This result can be expressed in other ways:

The perpendicular from the centre of a circle to a chord meets the chord at its midpoint.  
The line joining the centre of a circle to the midpoint of a chord is perpendicular to the chord.

You can use this fact to find the lengths of chords and the lengths of sides of right-angled triangles drawn between the centre and the chord.

# WORKED EXAMPLE 1

Chord AB is drawn in a circle with a radius of  $7\mathrm{cm}$  If the chord is  $3\mathrm{cm}$  from the centre of the circle, find the length of the chord correct to 2 decimal places.

# Answer

$PB^{2} = OB^{2} - OP^{2}$  (Rearrange Pythagoras' theorem)

$$
\begin{array}{l} = 7 ^ {2} - 3 ^ {2} \\ = 4 9 - 9 \\ = 4 0 \\ \end{array}
$$

$$
\therefore P B = \sqrt {4 0}
$$

$$

# MATHEMATICAL CONNECTIONS

This is another situation where Pythagoras' theorem is useful. By now you should be familiar with it and be able to use it to solve problems involving right-angled triangles in a range of different contexts.

# Equal chords are equidistant from the centre and chords equidistant from the centre are equal in length

If chords  $AB$  and  $CD$  are the same length, then  $OM = ON$ , and vice versa.

This is true because triangle OAM is congruent to triangle ODN and because the circle has rotational symmetry about its centre,  $O$ .

When you are asked for the distance from a point to a line, it is always the perpendicular distance which is expected. This is the shortest distance from the point to the line.

# TIP

Think about how you could you prove triangle OAM  $\equiv$  triangle ODN; remember OA and OD are radii of the circle.

# WORKED EXAMPLE 2

O is the centre of the circle, radius 11 cm.

AB and CD are chords,  $AB = 14\mathrm{cm}$

If  $OX = OY$  find the length of OY correct to 2 decimal places.

# Answer

Since  $OX = OY$  , chords are equidistant so,  $AB = CD = 14cm$

$CY = YD = 7$  cm (OY is the perpendicular bisector of CD)

$$
\text {A n g l e} O Y D = 9 0 ^ {\circ}
$$

$$
\begin{array}{l} O Y ^ {2} = O D ^ {2} - Y D ^ {2} (\text {P y t h a g o r a s}) \\ = 1 1 ^ {2} - 7 ^ {2} \\ = 1 2 1 - 4 9 \\ = 7 2 \\ \end{array}
$$

$$
\therefore O Y = \sqrt {7 2} = 8. 4 9 \mathrm {c m}
$$

# Two tangents drawn to a circle from the same point outside the circle are equal in length

$A$  and  $B$  are the points of contact of the tangents drawn from  $P$ .

The result is  $PA = PB$ .

In addition:

the tangents subtend equal angles at the centre (i.e. angle  $POA =$  angle  $POB$  
the line joining the centre to the point where the tangents meet bisects the angle between the tangents. (i.e. angle  $OPA =$  angle  $OPB$  -

You can show the two tangents are equal in length by proving that triangle  $OAP$  is congruent to triangle  $OBP$ , but in order to do this you need to use the 'tangent perpendicular to radius' property that you will learn about in Section 19.4.

# 19.4 Angle relationships in circles

Circles have many useful angle properties that you can use to solve problems.

# Useful properties of circles

The angle in a semicircle is a right angle  $(90^{\circ})$

Read through Worked example 5 to see how to work out the size of an angle in a semicircle.

# WORKED EXAMPLE 5

AB is the diameter of a circle. C is the centre. D is any point on the circumference. Remember that all radii of a circle are equal. Work out the size of angle ADB.

# Answer

$AC = CB = CD$  (radii of circle)   
: triangle ACD and triangle BCD are isosceles.   
: angle CAD = angle ADC = x   
and angle CDB = angle DBC = y   
But  $2x + 2y = 180^{\circ}$  (sum of angles in triangle ABD)   
:  $x + y + 90^{\circ}$    
so angle ADB = 90°

![](images/6856aae4a9f04dc6bd9c4e66480bc00bb26f9b78fc020dfc20228ef8b5239a8b.jpg)

# The angle between the tangent and radius is  $90^{\circ}$

Look at the diagram carefully.

A tangent touches a circle at one point only.

If you draw lines from the centre to points on the tangent, you can see that the shortest possible line is a radius. (OA).

You already know that the shortest distance from a point to a line is the perpendicular distance from the point to the line.

So, the radius is perpendicular to the tangent.

It follows that angles  $a$  and  $b$  are right angles.

$AB$  is an arc of a circle with centre  $O$ .  $P$  is a point on the circumference, but not on the arc  $AB$ . The angle at the centre theorem states that:

angle  $AOB = 2\times$  angle  $APB$

As you saw before, this is also true when  $AB$  is a semicircular arc. The angle at the centre theorem states that the angle in a semicircle is  $90^\circ$ . This is because, in this case, angle  $AOB$  is a straight line  $(180^\circ)$ .

# Angles in the same segment are equal

In these two diagrams,  $p = q$ . Each of the angles  $p$  and  $q$  is half the angle subtended by the arc  $AB$  at the centre of the circle.

The opposite angles of a cyclic quadrilateral add up to  $180^{\circ}$

A cscic quadrilateral is one that has all four vertices touching the circumference of a circle.

Look at the diagrams and follow the working to see why why the opposite angles add up to  $180^{\circ}$ .

$x = 2a$  (angle at centre theorem, minor arc  $BD$ )

$y = 2c$  (angle at centre theorem, major arc  $BD$ )

$$
\therefore x + y = 2 a + 2 c
$$

But  $x + y = 360^{\circ}$  (angles round a point)

$$
\therefore a + c = 1 8 0 ^ {\circ}
$$

By a similar argument:

$$
b + d = 1 8 0 ^ {\circ}
$$

Each exterior angle of a cyclic quadrilateral is equal to the interior angle opposite to it. Worked example 6 shows why this is the case.

This is called the intersecting chords theorem.

# Alternate segment theorem

You already know that where a tangent and diameter of a circle meet they form a right angle. The diameter will divide the circle into two semicircles.

You also know that a diameter of any circle is a chord that passes through the centre of the circle. When a chord meets a tangent but does not pass through the centre, the circle is divided into a major segment and a minor segment. The point at which the tangent and chord meet is called the point of contact.

![](images/483440df0e6a8b8c88166d11da8c954d53167f6e540d21f70bdd5caee6253799.jpg)

You can draw two possible angles between the tangent and this chord. One crosses the major segment and the other crosses the minor segment.

# Understanding the alternate segment theorem

1 a Follow these instructions.

Draw three large circles.  
- Draw a tangent to each circle, taking care to be as accurate as possible - your line should only touch the circle once.  
Draw a chord so that it meets the tangent.  
- Draw an angle between the tangent and chord. You can choose either angle.  
Work out which segment is the alternate segment and draw an angle in it.  
Measure, as accurately as you can, both the angle in the alternate segment and the angle between the tangent and the chord.

b What do you notice?

The alternate segment theorem states that the angle between the tangent and chord is always equal to the angle in the alternate segment. The diagram shows which angles are equal to which:

2 How do you prove the alternate segment theorem?

This is an interesting proof because it will use some of the theorems that you already know.

Begin by drawing the circle, chord, tangent, angle and angle in the alternate segment. Call the angles  $x$  and  $y$  respectively and label the point where the chord meets the tangent  $P$ .

A B C + B A C + 4 0 ^ {\circ} = 1 8 0 ^ {\circ}
$$

$$
\therefore A B C = B A C = 7 0 ^ {\circ}
$$

By the alternate segment theorem, angle  $ABC =$  angle  $ADB = 70^{\circ}$ .

$$
S _ {0} x = 7 0 ^ {\circ}

# Histograms and cumulative frequency diagrams

# IN THIS CHAPTER YOU WILL:

- construct and use histograms with unequal intervals  
- draw cumulative frequency tables  
- construct cumulative frequency diagrams  
estimate and interpret the median, percentiles, quartiles and interquartile range.

Look at the three histograms on the display screen in the photo below. How is a histogram similar to a bar chart? How is it different? The shape of a histogram allows you see where most of the measurements are located and how spread out they are. Describe the distribution of the data values in the dark blue histogram at the bottom left of the screen.

![](images/1bb80d7e04b8196c9ead38ba786ee83380100037a1203bbe3072be7212936e61.jpg)

We live in an age of big data, which makes it possible to understand almost anything that happens by collecting and analysing data associated with that event. The data that is collected is often represented visually to make it easier for people to interpret and understand it. You are going to learn how to use and interpret histograms and cumulative frequency diagrams to make sense of large groups of continuous data, sorted into different intervals.

# GETTING STARTED

1 The table shows the number of passengers carried by a taxi each trip for one weekend.

<table><tr><td>Number of passengers (x)</td><td>Frequency (f)</td><td>fx</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>12</td><td>p</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>5</td><td>q</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>6</td><td>r</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>9</td><td>s</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>t</td><td>52</td></tr></table>

a What does fx mean in the third column?  
b How do you work out the values of  $p,q,r$  and  $s?$  
c What is the value of t?  
What does the value 52 at the bottom of the third column represent?  
Use the formula mean  $= \frac{\text{sum of } f_{\text{X}}}{\text{total frequency}}$  to work out the mean number of passengers.  
What is the mode of this data set?  
What is the median number of passengers?

# GETTING STARTED CONTINUED

2 Imagine you are an online tutor and a student brings this diagram to the lesson and asks you to explain what it is and how to draw it. What would you tell them?

![](images/6c6a515efe9ba13e61aca2b4a4ac6187891c7832c7f4e27c86106c1365ef3362.jpg)

# 20.1 Histograms

A histogram shows the distribution of continuous, grouped data. Look at this histogram showing the ages of adult patients admitted to hospital with a diagnosis of pneumonia.

![](images/f36830770f31d24916b0e123d1f3fffa9edfcd1e61357db5c200ec9258e2b393.jpg)

In this case, the class interval is 8 years. The shape of the graph shows that most patients admitted to hospital for pneumonia tend to be older (70 years or more) and that fewer middle-aged adults are admitted to hospital with pneumonia. You can read the number of patients in each class from the frequency axis.

# LINK

Histograms are one of the most useful tools in epidemiology. They are used to organise and display a large set of measurements or numerical data in a simple way, so they are often used to display data related to public health events. The class intervals may show characteristics such as age, body temperature, exposure time and other factors relevant to the event.

This histogram shows data grouped in unequal intervals. You can see that the first interval  $(0\mathrm{km / h}\leqslant \nu <  50\mathrm{km / h})$  is much larger than the others.

![](images/956c140e903093fce9aefb6483150583951fe49e5c774d15ec4c57bc5c42456d.jpg)

On a histogram with unequal class intervals:

- The horizontal scale is continuous and each column of the graph is drawn above a particular class interval.  
The frequency of the data is shown by the area of the bars. Frequency density is shown against the vertical axis.

# Working with unequal class intervals

When the class intervals are not equal you cannot use the height of each bar to work out the frequency. Instead, you need to use the area of each bar.

When the class intervals are unequal you use the vertical scale to show the frequency density:

$$
\text {F r e q u e n c y d e n s i t y} = \frac {\text {f r e q u e n c y}}{\text {c l a s s w i d t h}}
$$

Frequency density takes into account the frequency relative to the size of the class interval and is used for comparing data in different-sized intervals.

# LINK

Density is used to express how much of a substance there is in a particular volume or area. For example, population density tells you how many people there are per square kilometre and the density of a metal is a measure of the mass of the metal per cubic centimetre. Frequency density looks at the frequency per unit of measurement along the horizontal axis.

# MATHEMATICAL CONNECTIONS

You worked with grouped data in Chapter 4.

# TIP

By rearranging the formula, you can see that frequency is equal to the area of a bar. You can use this to help you read frequencies from the histogram. Many questions are based on this principle.

# WORKED EXAMPLE 1

Here is a table showing the heights of 25 plants. Draw a histogram to show these results.

<table><tr><td>Height in cm</td><td>Number of plants</td></tr><tr><td>5 ≤ h ≤ 15</td><td>4</td></tr><tr><td>15 &lt; h ≤ 20</td><td>8</td></tr><tr><td>20 &lt; h ≤ 25</td><td>7</td></tr><tr><td>25 &lt; h ≤ 40</td><td>6</td></tr></table>

# WORKED EXAMPLE 1 CONTINUED

# Answer

First work out the frequency density by adding columns to your frequency distribution table like this:

<table><tr><td>Height (h) in cm</td><td>Number of plants</td><td>Class width</td><td>Frequency density (frequency + class width)</td></tr><tr><td>5 ≤ h ≤ 15</td><td>4</td><td>10</td><td>4/10 = 0.4</td></tr><tr><td>15 &lt; h ≤ 20</td><td>8</td><td>5</td><td>8/5 = 1.6</td></tr><tr><td>20 &lt; h ≤ 25</td><td>7</td><td>5</td><td>7/5 = 1.4</td></tr><tr><td>25 &lt; h ≤ 40</td><td>6</td><td>15</td><td>6/15 = 0.4</td></tr></table>

Next draw the axes. You will need to decide on a suitable scale for both the horizontal and the vertical axes.

Once you have done this, draw the histogram, paying careful attention to the scales on the axes.

![](images/2e0eb739c63e425b9dad4339a5aa0d698cf435ca06f5b7169ed587428fd71262.jpg)

# TIP

If you plotted the data against frequency instead of frequency density (see histogram), it looks like there are more plants in the 25-40 class compared to the 5-10 class but actually, their frequency densities are the same (see histogram in Worked example 1). The larger size of

![](images/bc7fd48c516ebeb582f66f2668737f66514898cde75dd988f0cf30fd618aa8e6.jpg)

interval is misleading here, so we use frequency density as it is a better way to compare frequencies in classes of different sizes.

# TIP

The heights in cm are the class intervals. The number of plants is the frequency.

# REFLECTION

What ideas were new to you in this section?

How did you apply ideas from earlier sections and other areas of mathematics to understand and make sense of this work?

# Exercise 20.1

1 140 people at a school fund-raising event were asked to guess how many sweets were in a large glass jar. Those who guessed correctly were put into a draw to win the sweets as a prize. The table shows the guesses.

<table><tr><td>No. of sweets (n)</td><td>Frequency (f)</td></tr><tr><td>100 ≤ n ≤ 200</td><td>18</td></tr><tr><td>200 &lt; n ≤ 250</td><td>18</td></tr><tr><td>250 &lt; n ≤ 300</td><td>32</td></tr><tr><td>300 &lt; n ≤ 350</td><td>31</td></tr><tr><td>350 &lt; n ≤ 400</td><td>21</td></tr><tr><td>400 &lt; n ≤ 500</td><td>20</td></tr></table>

a Use the table to calculate the frequency density for each class.  
b Construct a histogram to display the results. Use a scale of  $1\mathrm{cm} = 100$  sweets on the horizontal axis and a scale of  $1\mathrm{cm} = 0.2$  units on the vertical axis.

# 20.2 Cumulative frequency

Sometimes you may be asked questions such as:

How many people type fewer than 20 words per minute?  
How many cars were travelling above  $100\mathrm{km / h}$  
How many students scored less than  $50\%$  on the test?

In statistics you can use a cumulative frequency table or a cumulative frequency curve to answer questions about data up to a particular class boundary. You can also use the cumulative frequencies to estimate and interpret the median and the value of other positions of a data set.

# Cumulative frequency tables

Cumulative frequency is a 'running total' of the scores or results (the frequency in each group). The cumulative frequency gives the number of results which are less than, or equal to, a particular class boundary. This table shows how many students got a particular mark out of 10 (the frequency of each result) as well as the cumulative frequency.

# TIP

Cumulative means increasing as more is added'. In daily use we might use the word 'accumulating' to mean the same thing.

<table><tr><td>Score out of 10</td><td>Frequency (f)</td><td>Cumulative frequency</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>4</td><td>4</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>5</td><td>4 + 5 = 9</td></tr><tr><td>5</td><td>3</td><td>9 + 3 = 12</td></tr><tr><td>6</td><td>3</td><td>12 + 3 = 15</td></tr><tr><td>7</td><td>5</td><td>20</td></tr><tr><td>8</td><td>7</td><td>27</td></tr><tr><td>9</td><td>2</td><td>29</td></tr><tr><td>10</td><td>1</td><td>30</td></tr><tr><td>Total</td><td>30</td><td></td></tr></table>

Each entry in the cumulative frequency column is calculated by adding the frequency of the current class to the previous cumulative frequency (or by adding all the frequencies up to and including the current class).  
The last figure in the cumulative frequency column must equal the sum of the frequencies because all results will be below or equal to the highest result.

# WORKED EXAMPLE 2

The heights of plants were measured during an experiment. The results are summarised in the table.

<table><tr><td>Height (h cm)</td><td>Frequency</td></tr><tr><td>0 &lt; h ≤ 5</td><td>20</td></tr><tr><td>5 &lt; h ≤ 10</td><td>40</td></tr><tr><td>10 &lt; h ≤ 15</td><td>60</td></tr><tr><td>15 &lt; h ≤ 25</td><td>80</td></tr><tr><td>25 &lt; h ≤ 50</td><td>50</td></tr><tr><td>Total</td><td>250</td></tr></table>

a Draw a cumulative frequency table for this distribution.  
b Determine which class interval contains the median height.

b  $15 <   h\leqslant 25$

The heights are given for 250 flowers, so the median height must be the mean of the height of the 125th and 126th flower. If you look at the cumulative frequency you can see that this value falls into the fourth height class (the 125th and 126th are both greater than 120 but less than 200).

# MATHEMATICAL CONNECTIONS

Cumulative frequency curves allow you to estimate the median when there is a large number of data and you don't want to arrange the raw data in order.

# Cumulative frequency curves

When you plot the cumulative frequencies against the upper boundaries of each class interval you get a cumulative frequency curve. Cumulative frequency curves can be used to estimate other values.

Cumulative frequency curves are also called ogive curves or ogives because they take the shape of narrow pointed arches called ogees.

# WORKED EXAMPLE 3

The examination marks of 300 students are summarised in the table.

<table><tr><td>Mark</td><td>Frequency</td></tr><tr><td>1-10</td><td>3</td></tr><tr><td>11-20</td><td>7</td></tr><tr><td>21-30</td><td>13</td></tr><tr><td>31-40</td><td>29</td></tr><tr><td>41-50</td><td>44</td></tr><tr><td>51-60</td><td>65</td></tr><tr><td>61-70</td><td>70</td></tr><tr><td>71-80</td><td>49</td></tr><tr><td>81-90</td><td>14</td></tr><tr><td>91-100</td><td>6</td></tr></table>

# TIP

You must plot the cumulative frequency at the upper end point of the class interval. Do not confuse this section with the midpoint calculations you use to estimate the mean in frequency tables.

c The median is the middle value. You can find the middle value by dividing the total frequency by 2:

$$
\frac {3 0 0}{2} = 1 5 0, \text {s o t h e m e d i a n m a r k i s t h e 1 5 0 t h r e s u l t}.
$$

Draw a line from the 150th student (on the vertical axis) parallel to the marks (horizontal) axis. Drop a perpendicular from where this line cuts the graph. Read the value from the horizontal axis.

The median mark is 58.

# WORKED EXAMPLE 4

This cumulative frequency curve shows the journey times to school for different students.

Use the curve to find or estimate:

a the total number of students  
b the median journey time  
c the number of students who took less than 10 minutes to get to school  
d the number of students who had journey times greater than 30 minutes  
e the number of students who took between 40 minutes and one hour to get to school.

a 50

The top of the curve is at 50, so this is the total frequency.

b 38

50 25 25

# WORKED EXAMPLE 5

Twenty bean seeds were planted for a biology experiment. The heights of the plants were measured after three weeks and recorded in the table.

<table><tr><td>Heights (hcm)</td><td>0 &lt; h ≤ 3</td><td>3 &lt; h ≤ 6</td><td>6 &lt; h ≤ 9</td><td>9 &lt; h ≤ 12</td></tr><tr><td>Frequency</td><td>2</td><td>5</td><td>10</td><td>3</td></tr></table>

a Find an estimate for the mean height.  
b Draw a cumulative frequency curve and find an estimate for the median height.

# Answers

a You will need the midpoints of the classes to find an estimate of the mean, and you need the cumulative frequency to find an estimate of the median, so you must add more columns to the table. Don't forget to label the new columns.

<table><tr><td>Heights (hcm)</td><td>Midpoint (x)</td><td>Frequency (f)</td><td>Frequency × midpoint (fx)</td><td>Cumulative frequency</td></tr><tr><td>0 &lt; h ≤ 3</td><td>1.5</td><td>2</td><td>3</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td>3 &lt; h ≤ 6</td><td>4.5</td><td>5</td><td>22.5</td><td>7</td></tr><tr><td>6 &lt; h ≤ 9</td><td>7.5</td><td>10</td><td>75</td><td>17</td></tr><tr><td>9 &lt; h ≤ 12</td><td>10.5</td><td>3</td><td>31.5</td><td>20</td></tr><tr><td>Total</td><td></td><td>Σf = 20</td><td>132</td><td></td></tr></table>

Estimated mean height  $= \frac{132}{20} = 6.6\mathrm{cm}$  (mean  $= \frac{\text{total} f x}{\text{total} f}$ )

b

$\frac{20}{2} = 10$  so the median height is the 10th value. Median height  $= 7.0\mathrm{cm}$

# MATHEMATICAL CONNECTIONS

You learnt how to estimate the mean using grouped data in Chapter 12.

# TIP

The symbol  $\Sigma$  is the Greek letter capital 'sigma'. It is used to mean 'sum'. So,  $\Sigma f$  simply means, 'the sum of all the frequencies'.

# Exercise 20.2

1 The heights of 25 plants were measured and the results are summarised in the table.

<table><tr><td>Height (h) in cm</td><td>5＜h≤16</td><td>16＜h≤20</td><td>20＜h≤25</td><td>25＜h≤40</td></tr><tr><td>Number of plants</td><td>3</td><td>7</td><td>10</td><td>5</td></tr></table>

a Draw a cumulative frequency table for this distribution.  
b In which interval does the median plant height lie?  
c Draw the cumulative frequency curve and use it to estimate, to the nearest centimetre, the median plant height.

2 The table shows the amount of money, $x, spent on books by a group of students.

<table><tr><td>Amount spent</td><td>No. of students</td></tr><tr><td>00</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>104</td><td>4</td></tr><tr><td>208</td><td>8</td></tr><tr><td>3012</td><td>12</td></tr><tr><td>4011</td><td>11</td></tr><tr><td>505</td><td>5</td></tr></table>

a Calculate an estimate of the mean amount of money per student spent on books.  
b Use the information in the table above to find the values of  $p,q$  and  $r$  in the cumulative frequency table.

<table><tr><td>Amount spent ($x)</td><td>x ≤ 10</td><td>x ≤ 20</td><td>x ≤ 30</td><td>x ≤ 40</td><td>x ≤ 50</td><td>x ≤ 60</td></tr><tr><td>Cumulative frequency</td><td>0</td><td>4</td><td>p</td><td>q</td><td>r</td><td>40</td></tr></table>

c Using a scale of 1 cm to represent 10 units on each axis, draw a cumulative frequency diagram.  
d Use your diagram to estimate the median amount spent.

3 The cumulative frequency table shows the distribution of the masses of the children attending a clinic.

<table><tr><td>Mass (m) in kilograms</td><td>Cumulative frequency</td></tr><tr><td>0 &lt; m ≤ 10</td><td>12</td></tr><tr><td>0 &lt; m ≤ 20</td><td>26</td></tr><tr><td>0 &lt; m ≤ 30</td><td>33</td></tr><tr><td>0 &lt; m ≤ 40</td><td>41</td></tr><tr><td>0 &lt; m ≤ 50</td><td>46</td></tr><tr><td>0 &lt; m ≤ 60</td><td>50</td></tr></table>

a Draw a cumulative frequency diagram. Use a horizontal scale of  $1\mathrm{cm} = 10\mathrm{kg}$  and a vertical scale of  $0.5\mathrm{cm} = 5$  children.  
b Estimate the median mass.  
c How many children had a mass of  $45\mathrm{kg}$  or more?

# Quartiles

In Chapter 12 you found the range (the biggest value - the smallest value) to see how dispersed various sets of data were. However, the range is easily affected by outliers (extreme or unusual values), so it is not always the best measure of how the data is spread out.

You can divide the data shown on a cumulative frequency curve into quartiles to find the interquartile range, which is more representative than the range because it is not affected by extreme values.

This cumulative frequency curve the marks obtained by 64 students in a test.

When finding the positions of the quartiles from a cumulative frequency curve you do not use the  $\frac{(n + 1)}{4}, \frac{(n + 1)}{2}$  and  $\frac{3}{4}(n + 1)$  rules that you met for discrete data in

Chapter 12. Instead, you use:  $\frac{n}{4}, \frac{n}{2}$  and  $\frac{3n}{4}$ .

Looking at the curve, you can see that:

48 students scored less than 15 marks. 15 marks is the upper quartile or third quartile  $Q_{3}$ .  
32 students scored less than 13 marks. 13 marks is the second quartile  $Q_{2}$ , or median mark.  
16 students scored less than 11 marks. 11 marks is the lower quartile or first quartile  $O_{1}$

# MATHEMATICAL CONNECTIONS

Revise the work you did on quartiles and the interquartile range in Chapter 12 if you need to.

# TIP

Describing how 'dispersed' data is, is the same as describing how 'spread out' it is. So we can say that the range is a 'measure of dispersion' or a 'measure of spread'.

# TIP

Whole number values are being used in this example to make it easier to understand. Usually your answers will be estimates and they will involve decimal fractions.

# The interquartile range

The interquartile range (IQR) is the difference between the upper and lower quartiles:  $Q_{3} - Q_{1}$ .

In effect, this is the range of the middle  $50\%$  of the scores, or the median of the upper half of the values minus the median of the lower half of the values.

In the example about marks scored by students, the IQR  $= 15 - 11 = 4$

Because the interquartile range does not use any extreme small or large values it is considered a more reliable measure of spread than the range.

# Answers

n=1000

So the position of  $Q_{2}$  on the vertical axis is  $\frac{n}{2} = \frac{1000}{2} = 500$ .

Draw the lines on the graph.

Estimate the median from the horizontal axis as 30 marks.

b n=1000

So the position of  $Q_{1}$  on the vertical axis is  $\frac{n}{4} = \frac{1000}{4} = 250$ .

An estimate for the lower quartile, from the horizontal axis is 10 marks.

$n = 1000$

So the position of  $Q_{3}$  on the vertical axis is  $\frac{3n}{4} = \frac{3 \times 1000}{4} = 750$ .

An estimate for the upper quartile, from the horizontal axis is 90 marks.

d IQR = Q3 - Q1

$$
\begin{array}{l} = 9 0 - 1 0 \\ = 8 0 \text {m a r k s} \\ \end{array}
$$

# Percentiles

When you are dealing with large amounts of data, such as examination results for the whole country, or the average height and mass of all children in different age groups, it is useful to divide the data into even smaller groups called percentiles.

To find the position of a percentile use the formula  $\frac{pn}{100}$ , where  $p$  is the percentile you are looking for and  $n$  is how much data you have (the total frequency).

Using the data set in Worked example 6:

The position of the 10th percentile on the cumulative frequency axis is:

$$
\mathrm {P} _ {1 0} = \frac {1 0 \times 1 0 0 0}{1 0 0} = 1 0 0
$$

The position of the 85th percentile on the cumulative frequency axis is:

$$
\mathrm {P} _ {8 5} = \frac {8 5 \times 1 0 0 0}{1 0 0} = 8 5 0
$$

Remember that 100 and 850 are only the positions of the 10th and 85th percentile. To find the actual values of the percentiles you need to use the cumulative frequency graph.

# TIP

The position of percentile  $p$  is the value at  $p$  percent  $= \frac{p}{100} \times n$ .

# WORKED EXAMPLE 7

The cumulative frequency curve shows the test results of 200 candidates who have applied for an internship at a media company. Only those who score above the 80th percentile will be invited for an interview. What is the lowest score that can be obtained to be offered an interview?

![](images/43ba5d9dffc6d0125298f766d42b6dd91aa2562143fc2418e26e6ab4f66611ff.jpg)

# Answer

80% of 200 is 160.

So, the value of P80 is a test score of 35. (Read off the graph where the curve is 160.)

Only those candidates who scored above 35 marks on the test will be invited for an interview.

# SUMMARY

Do you know ...?

Histograms are specialised bar graphs used for displaying continuous and grouped data.  
If the class widths are unequal, the bars are not equally wide and the vertical axis shows the frequency density.  
frequency per class interval Frequency density  $=$  class width  
Cumulative frequency is a running total of the class frequencies up to each upper class boundary.  
When cumulative frequencies are plotted they give a cumulative frequency curve or ogive.  
The curve can be used to estimate the median value in the data.  
The data can be divided into four equal groups called quartiles. The interquartile range is the difference between the upper and lower quartiles  $(Q_{1} - Q_{1})$ .  
Large amounts of data can be divided into percentiles, which divide the data into 100 equal groups. If a score of 20 out of 25 is at the 82nd percentile it means that  $82\%$  of the scores are below 20.

# KEY WORDS

direct proportion inverse proportion rate ratio speed

A ratio compares amounts in a particular order. The amounts are expressed in the same units and are called the terms of the ratio. A ratio is usually written in the form  $a:b$ . Actual measurements are not given in a ratio, what is important is the proportion of the amounts. Ratio is used when working with scale on maps, models and plans.

A rate compares two different quantities and the units of both are given in the rate. For example, speed is often given in kilometres per hour; this is a rate which compares distance travelled to the time taken.

# GETTING STARTED

1 Simplify each ratio.

a 600:400

b 32:72

c 60cm to 2 metres

2 The sectors in this pie chart are in the ratio  $1:2:3:4$ .

a Calculate the angle at the centre of each sector.  
b What percentage of the whole does sector C represent?

3 a Discuss where you might see each of these rates and describe what is being measured.

• $/metre squared

litres/day

• $/hour

metres/second

- Runs/over

- bpm

kg/metre squared

• $/£

b List at least three more examples of rates used in daily life.

4 Quantity  $y$  is directly proportionate to quantity  $x$ . When  $y$  is 12,  $x$  is 3.

a Work out the values a to e in the table.  
b What rule connects quantity  $y$  and quantity  $x$  in this proportion?

<table><tr><td>x</td><td>3</td><td>a</td><td>5</td><td>c</td><td>1.5</td><td>e</td></tr><tr><td>y</td><td>12</td><td>4</td><td>b</td><td>48</td><td>d</td><td>14</td></tr></table>

# TIP

Rates are often used in daily life. When we write a rate such as kilometres per hour, we use the abbreviation km/h. The / means 'per'.

# 21.1 Working with ratio

A ratio is a numerical comparison of amounts. The order in which you write the amounts is very important. For example, if there is one teacher for every 25 students in a school, then the ratio of teachers to students is 1:25.

We normally write ratios in the form  $1:25$ , but when we work with them, it is sometimes useful to express the ratio as a fraction.

Think about the teacher to student ratio 1:25. This means there is 1 teacher for every 25 students.

You can write this as  $\frac{1}{25}$ . This fraction compares the number of teachers with the number of students. It means that there is  $\frac{1}{25}$  as many teachers as there are students.

So, if there are 150 students you can use the fraction to work out how many teachers there are:

$$
\begin{array}{l} \frac {1}{2 5} = \frac {?}{1 5 0} \\ \frac {1}{2 5} \text {o f} 1 5 0 = 6 \\ \end{array}
$$

So, for 150 students there will be 6 teachers.

6 is equivalent to  $\frac{1}{25}$  and this matches the ratio 1:25.

When you write two quantities as a ratio, you must make sure they are both in the same units. For example, the ratio of 20c to $1 is not 20:1, it is 20:100 because there are 100 cents in a dollar.

# Writing ratios in simplest form

Ratios are in their simplest form when you write them using the smallest whole numbers possible. The ratio of 20:100 above is not in its simplest form. You can simplify ratios in the same way that you simplify fractions:

$$
\frac {2 0}{1 0 0} = \frac {2}{1 0} = \frac {1}{5} \text {s o} 2 0: 1 0 0 = 1: 5
$$

If a breakfast cereal has 200 grams of rice for every 300 grams of wheat and 500 grams of corn, the ratio of rice to wheat to corn is  $200:300:500$ . To find the simplest form, divide each part of the ratio by 100 to get  $2:3:5$ .

# WORKED EXAMPLE 1

A painter mixed eight litres of white paint with three litres of red paint to get pink paint.

What is the ratio of:

a red paint to white paint?  
b white paint to the total amount of paint in the mixture?  
c red paint to the total amount of paint in the mixture?

# TIP

When you say a ratio, you use the word 'to', so you say 5:2 as '5 to 2'.

# WORKED EXAMPLE 1 CONTINUED

# Answers

a 3 litres to 8 litres  $= 3:8$  
b 8 litres white out of a total of 11 litres so 8:11 is the required ratio.  
c 3 litres red out of a total of 11 litres so 3:11 is the required ratio.

# LINK

Ratios are commonly used in food science to compare the ingredients in food and to give dietary guidelines. Scientists may also use a measure called the protein efficiency ratio to determine the quality of proteins in food. Scientists have found that the carbohydrate: protein ratio in a meal can affect brain function, mood and metabolism in adults.

# WORKED EXAMPLE 2

To make concrete, you mix cement, sand and gravel in the ratio 1:2:4.

a What is the ratio of cement to gravel?  
b What is the ratio of sand to gravel?  
c What is the ratio of gravel to the total amount of concrete?  
d What fraction of the concrete is cement?

# Answers

a Cement to gravel is 1:4  
b Sand to gravel is  $2:4 = 1:2$  
Concrete  $= 1 + 2 + 4 = 7$  parts  $\therefore$  gravel is 4 parts to 7, so 4:7 is the required ratio  
Concrete  $= 1 + 2 + 4 = 7$ $\therefore$  cement  $= \frac{1}{7}$

# Exercise 21.1

1 Write each of the following as a ratio:

a nine children to nine adults  
b one litre to five litres  
c 25 minutes to 3 minutes  
d 18 seconds to one minute  
e 15c to $1  
two millimetres out of every centimetre  
10 bags of sand for every 4 bags of gravel and 8 bags of cement.

# Equivalent ratios

Equivalent ratios are basically the same as equivalent fractions. If you multiply or divide the terms of the ratio by the same number (except 0) you get an equivalent ratio. Equivalent ratios are useful when you need to solve problems involving a missing amount.

# MATHEMATICAL CONNECTIONS

You dealt with common factors in Chapter 1 and you learnt about the reciprocals of fractions in Chapter 5.

# WORKED EXAMPLE 3

For each of the following ratios find the missing value.

a  $1:4 = x:20$

b  $4:9 = 24:y$

# Answers

Method 1: multiplying by a common factor.

a  $1:4 = x:20$

$$
2 0 + 5 = 4, \text {s o} 2 0 = 4 \times 5
$$

1:4=5:20

1 must be multiplied by 5 as well.

![](images/516a26e3065311c943a8b734a86ce4ae3b686636412c4cde99a10f6fb1af9e31.jpg)

Work out what 4 is multiplied by to get 20.

![](images/23c8b1dc1f2eaa424ee21d23e4df10f1ca254a4995de02b6a9c549213f95b2a8.jpg)

$$
2 0 \div 5 = 4, \text {s o} 2 0 = 4 \times 5
$$

For an equivalent ratio, you must multiply 1 by 5 as well.

b  $4:9 = 24:y$

$$
2 4 \div 4 = 6, \text {s o} 4 \times 6 = 2 4
$$

4:9=24:54

9 must be multiplied by 6 as well.

Method 2: cross multiplying fractions.

a  $\frac{1}{4} = \frac{x}{20}$

Write the ratios as fractions.

$$
x = 1 \times \frac {2 0}{4}
$$

Solve the equation by multiplying both sides by 20.

$$
x = 5
$$

4 24 b 9

Write each ratio as a fraction.

$$
\frac {9}{4} = \frac {y}{2 4}
$$

Take the reciprocal of the fractions (turn them upside down) to get  $y$  at the top and make the equation easier to solve.

$$
\frac {9 \times 2 4}{4} = y
$$

Solve the equation by multiplying both sides by 24.

$$
\frac {2 1 6}{4} = y
$$

$$
y = 5 4
$$

# REFLECTION

Two methods are shown for finding missing values in equivalent ratios. Which method made most sense to you? Why?

You learnt that if  $\frac{a}{b} = \frac{c}{d}$  then the cross-products ad and bc are equal.

Do you understand why this works or do you just follow the rule?

4 An alloy is a mixture of metals. Most of the gold used in jewellery is an alloy of pure gold and other metals which are added to make the gold harder. Pure gold is 24 carats (ct), so 18 carat gold is an alloy of gold and other metals in the ratio 18:6. In other words,  $\frac{18}{24}$  parts pure gold and  $\frac{6}{24}$  other metals.

# Dividing a quantity in a given ratio

Ratios can be used to divide or share quantities. There are two ways of solving problems like these.

Method 1: find the value of one part. This is the unitary method.

1 Add the values in the ratio to find the total number of parts involved.  
2 Divide the quantity by the total number of parts to find the quantity per part (the value of one part).  
3 Multiply the values in the ratio by the quantity per part to find the value of each part.

Method 2: express the shares as fractions. This is the ratio method.

1 Add the values in the ratio to find the total number of parts involved.  
2 Express each part of the ratio as a fraction of the total parts.  
3 Multiply the quantity by the fraction to find the value of each part.

# WORKED EXAMPLE 4

Share $24 between Jess and Anne in the ratio 3:5.

# Answer

Method 1

$$
3 + 5 = 8
$$

There are 8 parts in the ratio.

$$
2 4 + 8 = 3
$$

This is the value of 1 part.

$$
J e s g e t s \mathbb {9}
$$

Jess gets 3 parts:  $3 \times 3 = 9$

$$
\text {A n n e g e t s} \$ 15
$$

Anne gets 5 parts:  $5 \times 3 = 15$

# Method 2

$$
3 + 5 = 8
$$

There are 8 parts in the ratio.

Jess gets  $\frac{3}{8}$  of  $24 = \frac{3}{8} \times 24 = \frac{9}{8}$

Express each part as a fraction of the total parts and multiply by the quantity.

Anne gets 5/8 of $24 = 5/8 × 24 = $15

Scale drawings (maps and plans) and models such as the one of the Louvre Museum in Abu Dhabi (shown at the start of this chapter), are the same shape as the real objects but they are generally smaller.

Scale is a ratio. It can be expressed as 'length on drawing: real length'.

The scale of a map, plan or model is usually given as a ratio in the form  $1:n$ . For example, the architects who designed the new Louvre building for Abu Dhabi made a  $6\mathrm{m}$  wide scale model of the domed roof using aluminium rods to test how light would enter the dome. The scale of the model was  $1:33$ .

A scale of  $1:33$  means that a unit of measurement on the model must be multiplied by 33 to get the length (in the same units) of the real building. So, if the diameter of the dome in the model was  $6\mathrm{m}$ , then the diameter of the real dome is  $6\mathrm{m} \times 33 = 198\mathrm{m}$ .

# Expressing a ratio in the form  $1:n$

All ratio scales must be expressed in the form  $1:n$  or  $n:1$

To change a ratio so that one part  $= 1$  you need to divide both parts by the number that you want expressed as 1.

# WORKED EXAMPLE 5

Express  $5:1000$  in the form  $1:n$

Answer

$$
\begin{array}{l} 5: 1 0 0 0 = \frac {5}{5}: \frac {1 0 0 0}{5} \\ = 1: 2 0 0 \\ \end{array}
$$

Divide both sides by 5, i.e. the number that you want expressed as 1.

# WORKED EXAMPLE 6

Express  $4\mathrm{mm}:50\mathrm{cm}$  as a ratio scale.

Answer

4mm:50cm=4mm:500mm

$$
\begin{array}{l} = 4: 5 0 0 \\ = \frac {4}{4}: \frac {5 0 0}{4} \\ - 1: 1 2 5 \\ \end{array}
$$

Express the amounts in the same units first.

Divide by 4 to express in the form  $1:n$ .

# WORKED EXAMPLE 7

Write 22:4 in the form  $n:1$

Answer

$$
2 2: 4 = \frac {2 2}{4}: \frac {4}{4}
$$

$$
= 5. 5: 1
$$

Divide both sides by 4, i.e. the number that you want is expressed as 1.

In this form you may get a decimal answer on one side.

# MATHEMATICAL CONNECTIONS

Scale drawings were discussed in more detail in Chapter 15.

Some scale drawings, such as diagrams of cells in Biology, are larger than the real items they show. In an enlargement the scale is given in the form  $n:1$  (where  $n > 1$ ).

# TIP

The form  $1:n$  or  $n:1$  may give a ratio with decimal values.

# Solving scale problems

There are two main types of problems involving scale:

- calculating the real length of an object given its scaled length  
- calculating the scaled length of an object given its real length.

In both cases you will be told one of the lengths and the scale, expressed as 'length on the diagram: real length'.

You can write the scale as fractions and cross-multiply to find the unknown length.

# WORKED EXAMPLE 8

The scale of a map is 1:25000.

a What is real distance between two points that are  $5\mathrm{cm}$  apart on the diagram?  
b Express the real distance in kilometres.

# Answers

a Map distance: real distance  $= 1:25000$

$$
\begin{array}{l} \mathrm {S o}, 5 \mathrm {c m}: \times \mathrm {c m} = 1: 2 5 0 0 0 \\ \frac {5}{x} = \frac {1}{2 5 0 0 0} \\ 5 \times 2 5 0 0 0 = x \\ x = 1 2 5 0 0 0 \\ \end{array}
$$

$$
\therefore \text {R e a l} = 1 2 5 0 0 0 \mathrm {c m}
$$

b  $1\mathrm{km} = 100000\mathrm{cm}$

$$
\begin{array}{l} 1 2 5 0 0 0 \mathrm {c m} \div 1 0 0 0 0 0 \\ = 1. 2 5 \mathrm {k m} \\ \end{array}
$$

Substitute the map distance and use  $x$  to represent the unknown real distance.

Write the ratios as fractions.

Cross multiply to find the real distance.

The units in your answer will the same units as the map distance units.

From part (a) you know the real distance is  $120000\mathrm{cm}$

You know that  $1\mathrm{km} = 100000\mathrm{cm}$

So convert the real distance to km.

# WORKED EXAMPLE 9

A dam wall is  $480\mathrm{m}$  long. How many centimetres long will it be on a map with a scale of 1:12000?

# Answers

Map length: real length = 1:12000

Substitute the real length and use  $x$  to represent the unknown map length.

So,  $x_m:480m = 1:12000$

$$
\frac {x}{4 8 0} = \frac {1}{1 2 0 0 0}
$$

$$
\begin{array}{l} x = \frac {4 8 0}{1 2 0 0 0} 1 \\ x = 0. 0 4 \\ \end{array}
$$

∴ map distance = 0.04 m

$$
= 4 \mathrm {c m}
$$

Write the ratios as fractions.

Cross multiply to find the map length.

$1\mathrm{m} = 100\mathrm{cm}$  so multiply by 100 to convert the answer to cm.

# 21.3 Rates

A rate compares two different quantities. In a rate, the quantity of one thing is usually given in relation to one unit of the other thing. For example,  $750\mathrm{ml}$  per bottle,  $60\mathrm{km/h}$  or 100 people per square kilometre  $(\mathrm{km}^2)$ . You must give the units of both quantities in a rate.

Rates can be simplified just like ratios. When a rate is in simplest form, the first quantity is expressed per one unit of the second, so, for example,  $60\mathrm{km}$  per hour is in simplest form, but  $120\mathrm{km}$  per 2 hours is not. You solve rate problems in the same way that you solve ratio and proportion problems.

# WORKED EXAMPLE 11

492 people live in an area of  $12\mathrm{km}^2$ . Express this as a rate in its simplest terms.

# Answer

492 people in  $12\mathrm{km}^2$  
492 people per km²  
$= 41$  people/km²

Divide by 12 to get a rate per unit.

Don't forget to write the units.

# Average speed

You need to be able to work with speed, distance and time quantities to solve problems.

Average speed is one of the most commonly used rates. We talk about average speed because usually a vehicle will change speed during a journey. The driver might slow down, speed up or stop at an intersection. We use the total distance covered over time to calculate the average speed. The average speed is given as a rate comparing the units of distance to the units of time. For example, metres per second, kilometres per hour or miles per hour.

You can use the distance-time-speed triangle to help you solve problems related to distance, time or speed.

![](images/a40777b03ea5c348936c8b709062a8db922138dd0b50fcdc89720cfbbb3a926b.jpg)

If you cover the letter of the quantity you need to find, then the remaining letters in the triangle give you the calculation you need to do (a multiplication or a division). For example:

# TIP

$$

$$
\begin{array}{l} \therefore \text {s p e e d} = \frac {2 1 0}{3} \\ = 7 0 \mathrm {k m} / \mathrm {h} \\ \end{array}

# 21.4 Kinematic graphs

Kinematics is the study of how objects move. A kinematic graph may show how far an object moves over time or how its speed changes with time.

# Distance-time graphs

Graphs that show the connection between the distance an object has travelled and the time taken to travel that distance are called distance-time graphs or travel graphs.

On such graphs, time is normally shown along the horizontal axis and distance on the vertical axis.

![](images/e0c6123bfffa82a2403300dfed75e2265886010e6cf036d776732fd07f8b1856.jpg)

# TIP

In travel graphs time is an independent variable and it is always shown on the  $x$ -axis.

Look at the graph. Can you see that it shows the following journey:

a cycle ride for 4 minutes from home to a bus stop 1 km away  
a 2 minute wait for the bus  
a 7 km journey on the bus that takes 10 minutes.

The line of the graph remains horizontal while the person is waiting for the bus because they don't get any further from the starting point. The steeper the line, the faster the person is travelling.

# Speed in distance-time graphs

The steepness gradient of a graph gives an indication of speed.

- A straight line on a graph indicates a constant speed. Any change in the angle of the line indicates a change of speed.

![](images/303b064fb586e7f0b7ed08f619921fa3ede41025c5487166d96dd68a87b1164d.jpg)

The steeper the graph, the greater the speed.  
An upward slope and a downward slope represent movement in opposite directions.

The distance-time graph shown is for a person who walks, cycles and then drives for three equal periods of time. For each period, speed is given by the formula:

$$
\text {s p e e d} = \frac {\text {d i s t a n c e} \text {t r a v e l l e d}}{\text {t i m e} \text {t a k e n}}
$$

![](images/7089ebca6d4eb1b817a1c9cff2739db51be24a5be264f0f7cc92577784fd88ee.jpg)

Speed is a rate of change. A straight line from the origin shows a constant rate of change and you can use the formula  $\frac{\text{change in } y}{\text{change in } x}$  to find the rate of change.

If the gradient changes along the graph, the speed will be different for different time periods.

The gradient precisely describes the steepness of a line.

In the diagram, the steepness of line  $AB$  is measured by: increase in y-coordinate increase in x-coordinate

This is the same as  $\frac{\text{rise}}{\text{run}}$  or gradient of a straight line graph.

A positive gradient means that as  $x$  increases  $y$  also increases.

On a distance-time graph, the  $y$  value indicates distance from the starting point, so a positive gradient means the object is moving away from the starting point. A zero gradient means the  $y$ -value is not changing, so the object is not moving. A negative gradient means that as  $x$  increases the  $y$ -value decreases, so the object is moving back towards the starting point.

For a distance-time graph:

$$
\frac {\text {c h a n g e i n y - c o o r d i n a t e (d i s t a n c e)}}{\text {c h a n g e i n x - c o o r d i n a t e (t i m e)}} = \frac {\text {d i s t a n c e t r a v e l l e d}}{\text {t i m e t a k e n}} = \text {s p e e d}
$$

Therefore, the gradient of the graph tells you the speed of the object and its direction of motion. This is known as the velocity of the object.

![](images/071cd7839925435b48b42d0dd8cd684501d946f5578daf1a54e50d16c4feda49.jpg)

Here is another example:

The travel graph represents a car journey.

The horizontal sections have zero gradient (so the car was stationary during these times).

For section  $AB$ , the gradient is positive:

$$
\text {G r a d i e n t} = \frac {N B}{A N} = \frac {4 0 - 0}{0 . 5} = 8 0 \mathrm {k m / h}
$$

the velocity was  $80\mathrm{km / h}$  in the direction away from home.

For section  $CD$ , the gradient is negative:

$$

# MATHEMATICAL CONNECTIONS

You learned how to calculate the gradient of a straight line graph in Chapter 10. Remember the gradient of a line is:

positive if the line slopes up from left to right  
negative if the line slopes down from left to right.

# Speed-time graphs

In certain cases, the speed (or velocity) of an object may change. An increase in speed is called acceleration; a decrease in speed is called deceleration. A speed-time graph shows speed (rather than distance) on the vertical axis.

This graph shows a train journey between two stations.

![](images/7b4abfd2cbb365adea8fae651a9c5d8a3fabba79f463725da79830f32fae9eac.jpg)

The train starts at zero speed.  
The speed increases steadily reaching  $18\mathrm{m / s}$  after 15 seconds.  
The train travels at a constant speed (horizontal section) of  $18\mathrm{m / s}$  for 25 seconds.  
The train then slows down at a steady rate till it stops.  
The entire journey takes 60 seconds.

Look at the first part of the journey again.

The speed increased by  $18\mathrm{m / s}$  in 15 seconds.

$\frac{18\mathrm{m / s}}{15\mathrm{seconds}}$  is the gradient of the line representing the first part of the journey.

This is a rate of  $1.2\mathrm{m / s}$  every second. This is the rate of acceleration. You write this as  $1.2\mathrm{m / s^2}$  (or  $\mathrm{m / s / s}$

For a speed-time graph, the gradient = acceleration.

A positive gradient (acceleration) is an increase in speed.

A negative gradient (deceleration) is a decrease in speed.

# Distance travelled in a speed-time graph

You already know that distance = speed × time. On a speed-time graph, this is represented by the area of shapes under the sections of graph. You can use the graph to work out the distance travelled.

# MATHEMATICAL CONNECTIONS

You worked with distance, time and speed earlier in this chapter. Make sure you remember how to use and manipulate the formulae.

# TIP

You may sometimes see m/s written as m s-1 and m/s2 written as m s-2.

# WORKED EXAMPLE 16

This speed-time graph represents the motion of a particle over a period of five seconds.

![](images/c48f078452a6f80c8ef307b91d08129cf8afe1fefdae5cb6f3e0793c53a22933.jpg)

a During which periods of time was the particle accelerating?  
b Calculate the particle's acceleration 3 seconds after the start.  
c Calculate the distance travelled by the particle in the 5 seconds.

# Answers

a The particle was accelerating in the period 0 to 0.8 seconds (section OA) and in the period 2 to 3.5 seconds (section BC).  
b The gradient is constant between 2 and 3.5 seconds so acceleration was also constant in that period. So, the acceleration 3 seconds after the start is:

$$
\frac {2 5 - 1 5 (m / s)}{3 . 5 - 2 (s)} = \frac {1 0}{1 . 5} = 6. 7 m / s ^ {2}
$$

c Distance travelled  $=$  area under graph

$$
\begin{array}{l} = \text {a r e a} \vert + \text {a r e a} \vert + \text {a r e a} \vert + \text {a r e a} \vert + \text {a r e a} \vert + \text {a r e a} \vert \\ = \frac {1}{2} (0. 8 \times 1 5) + (1. 2 \times 1 5) + \frac {1}{2} (1. 5 \times 1 0) + (1. 5 \times 1 5) + (1. 5 \times 2 5) \\ = 6 + 1 8 + 7. 5 + 2 2. 5 + 3 7. 5 \\ = 9 1. 5 \\ \end{array}
$$

The distance travelled is  $91.5\mathrm{m}$

# MATHEMATICAL CONNECTIONS

The areas under a straight line graph will always be polygons. Apply the area formulae you learnt in Chapter 7 to calculate the area of the shapes under the graphs.

# Units are important

When you calculate acceleration and distance travelled from a speed-time graph, the unit of speed on the vertical axis must involve the same unit of time as on the horizontal axis. In the example above the speed unit is metres per second and, on the horizontal axis, time is also measured in seconds. These units are compatible.

If the units of time are not the same, convert the unit on one of the axes to a compatible unit.

# WORKED EXAMPLE 17

The diagram shows the distance-time graph for a short car journey. The greatest speed reached is  $60\mathrm{km / h}$  . The acceleration in the first two minutes and the deceleration in the last two minutes are constant.

![](images/4b1eb55c866f6abac8aaab2f9c4e0ec7324d89f08ea8c4ae7df6e34af7cc9d29.jpg)

b Calculate the average speed, in km/h, for the journey.

# Answers

a

![](images/a5b031ebe7ab6e98665a40d903f449f323db45c97ff326c7d6221dac17a3e7db.jpg)

Since the acceleration and deceleration are both constant, the speed-time graph consists of straight lines.

The greatest speed is  $60\mathrm{km / h}$

b Average speed = total distance / total time

$$
\begin{array}{l} = \frac {2 \mathrm {k m}}{(4 \text {m i n u t e s})} \\ = \frac {2 \times 1 5}{6 0 (\text {m i n u t e s})} \\ = 3 0 k m / h \\ \end{array}
$$

Units of speed are more commonly m/s or km/h so the units need changing.

Multiply top and bottom by 15 to get 60 minutes  $(= 1$  hour) on the bottom.

Calculate to give answer in km/h.

# 21.5 Proportion

Quantities increase or decrease in proportion if multiplying (or dividing) one quantity by a value results in multiplying (or dividing) the other quantity by the same value. In other words, there is a constant ratio between the corresponding elements of two sets.

# Direct proportion

When two quantities are in direct proportion they increase or decrease at the same rate. In other words, the ratio of the quantities is equivalent (in general terms,  $a:b = c:d$ ). If there is an increase or decrease in one quantity, the other will increase or decrease in the same proportion.

# LINK

Home economists, chefs and food technologists use proportional reasoning to mix ingredients, convert between units or work out the cost of a dish.

Here are some examples of quantities that are in direct proportion:

<table><tr><td>Speed (km/h)</td><td>0</td><td>45</td><td>60</td><td>75</td><td>90</td><td>120</td></tr><tr><td>Distance covered in an hour (km)</td><td>0</td><td>45</td><td>60</td><td>75</td><td>90</td><td>120</td></tr></table>

Distance = speed × time, so the faster you drive in a set time, the further you will travel in that time.

<table><tr><td>Number of items</td><td>0</td><td>1</td><td>2</td><td>3</td><td>4</td></tr><tr><td>Mass (kg)</td><td>0</td><td>2</td><td>4</td><td>6</td><td>8</td></tr></table>

If one item has a mass of  $2\mathrm{kg}$ , then two of the same item will have a mass of  $4\mathrm{kg}$  and so on. The more you have of the same item, the greater the mass will be.

<table><tr><td>Number of hours worked</td><td>0</td><td>1</td><td>2</td><td>3</td></tr><tr><td>Amount earned ($)</td><td>0</td><td>12</td><td>24</td><td>36</td></tr></table>

The more hours you work, the more you earn.

# Graphs of directly proportional relationships

If you draw the graph of a directly proportional relationship you will get a straight line that passes through the origin.

Of course, the converse (opposite) of this is also true. When a graph is a straight line that passes through the origin, one quantity is directly proportional to the other.

The unitary method is useful for solving a range of problems involving proportion. Using this method, you start by finding the value of one unit of the quantity, for example the price of one cupcake or the amount of rupees you would get for one dollar.

# WORKED EXAMPLE 18

Five bottles of perfume cost $200. What would 11 bottles cost?

# Answer

Unitary method

5 bottles cost $200

1 bottle costs  $200 + 5 =$ 40

11 bottles cost \(11 \times \\)40 = \\(440$

# WORKED EXAMPLE 18 CONTINUED

You can also solve this problem using the ratio method.

$$
\frac {5}{2 0 0} = \frac {1 1}{x}
$$

Write out each part as a fraction.

$$
\frac {2 0 0}{5} = \frac {x}{1 1}
$$

Take the reciprocal of both ratios (tum them upside down) to make it easier to solve the equation.

$$
\frac {2 0 0 \times 1 1}{5} = x
$$

$$
x = \$ 440

# Inverse proportion

In inverse proportion, one quantity decreases in the same proportion as the other quantity increases. Think about this in terms of money. If you have $20 to spend on pens, the number of pens you can buy depends on the price.

<table><tr><td>Price $</td><td>1</td><td>2</td><td>4</td><td>10</td></tr><tr><td>Number you can buy</td><td>20</td><td>10</td><td>5</td><td>2</td></tr></table>

In other words, as the price increases, the number of pens you can buy decreases. Looking at the table, you can see that as price doubles, the number of pens halves. The product of the price and the number you can buy for $20 is always 20.

The graph of an inversely proportional relationship is half of a hyperbola  $(y = \frac{a}{x}$  where  $a$  is positive) and not a straight line.

# WORKED EXAMPLE 19

A person travelling at  $30\mathrm{km / h}$  takes 24 minutes to get home from work. How long will the journey take if they travel at  $36\mathrm{km / h}$ ?

# Answer

30km/h takes 24 minutes.

This is inverse proportion; as one value decreases the other increases.

So,  $1\mathrm{km / h}$  would take  $30\times 24$  minutes.

To get  $1\mathrm{km / h}$  you divide the speed by 30, so multiply the time by 30.

at 36km/h it will take 30x24 36

To get  $36\mathrm{km / h}$  you multiply the speed by 36, so divide the time by 36.

$= 20$  minutes.

# 21.6 Direct and inverse proportion in algebraic terms

We can use generalised equations to represent direct and inverse relationships between two quantities,  $x$  and  $y$ , using  $k$  to represent a constant value.

# Direct proportion

If the values of two variables are always in the same ratio, we say that the variables are in direct proportion. If the variables are  $P$  and  $Q$ , you write this as  $P \propto Q$  and you read it as  $P$  is directly proportional to  $Q$ .

$P \propto Q$  means that  $\frac{P}{Q}$  is constant. That is,  $P = kQ$ , where  $k$  is a constant.

If the constant is 2, then  $P = 2Q$ . This means that whatever  $P$  is,  $Q$  will be double that.

You can also write this as  $\frac{P}{Q} = 2$ .

# Inverse proportion

If the product of the value of two variables is constant, the variables are said to be inversely proportional. If the variables are  $P$  and  $Q$ , you can write  $PQ = k$ , where  $k$  is a constant. This means that  $P$  is inversely proportional to  $Q$ .

$PQ = k$  can also be written as  $P = \frac{k}{Q}$

So  $P$  is inversely proportional to  $Q$  can be written as  $P \propto \frac{1}{Q}$ .

$F\propto \frac{1}{d^2}$  which means (as an equation)  $F = \frac{k}{d^2}$

When  $d = 3$  and  $F = 12, 12 = \frac{k}{3^2} = \frac{k}{9}$

$$
\begin{array}{l} \therefore k = 1 2 \times 9 = 1 0 8 \\ S _ {0}, F = \frac {1 0 8}{d ^ {2}} \\ \text {I f} d = 4, \text {t h e n} F = \frac {1 0 8}{d ^ {2}} = \frac {1 0 8}{4 ^ {2}} = 6. 7 5 \\ \end{array}

# WORKED EXAMPLE 25

The speed of water in a river is determined by a water-pressure gauge. The speed (vm/s) is directly proportional to the square root of the height (h cm) reached by the liquid in the gauge. Given that  $h = 36$  when  $v = 8$ , calculate the value of  $v$  when  $h = 18$ .

# Answer

$v \propto \sqrt{h}$  means that  $v = k\sqrt{h}$  where  $k$  is constant.

When  $y = 8$ ,  $h = 36$  and so  $8 = k\sqrt{36} = 6k$

It follows that  $k = \frac{4}{3}$  and the formula connecting  $v$  and  $h$  is  $v = \frac{4\sqrt{h}}{3}$ .

$$
\text {W h e n} h = 1 8, v = \frac {4 \sqrt {1 8}}{3} = 5. 6 6 (\text {t o} 3 \text {s . f .})

# SUMMARY

# Do you know ...?

A ratio is a comparison of two or more quantities in a set order. Ratios can be expressed in the form  $a:b$  or  $\frac{a}{b}$ . Ratios have no units.

Ratios can be simplified by multiplying or dividing both quantities by the same number. This method produces equivalent ratios.

Map scales are good examples of ratios in everyday life. The scale of a map is usually given in the form  $1:n$ . This allows you to convert map distances to real distances using the ratio scale.

A rate is a comparison of two different quantities. Usually a rate gives an amount of one quantity per unit of the other. Rates must include the units of the quantities.

Speed is one of the most common rates of change. Speed = distance ÷ time.

Kinematic graphs are used to show relationships between:

distance and time (distance-time graph)  
speed and time (speed-time graph)

and to solve problems in these areas.

# TIP

Sometimes you may see 'varies as' written instead of 'is directly proportional to'. Similarly, 'varies inversely with' means 'is inversely proportional to'.

# SUMMARY CONTINUED

The gradient of a distance-time graph shows how the speed changes over time.

Proportion is a constant ratio between two sets of numbers.

When quantities are in direct proportion they increase or decrease at the same rate.

When quantities are inversely proportional, one increases as the other decreases.

Algebraic expressions can be used to represent direct and indirect (inverse) proportion and to solve problems related to these concepts. The symbol for proportion is  $x$ .

# Are you able to ...?

# Chapter 22

# More equations, formulae and functions

# IN THIS CHAPTER YOU WILL:

make your own equations and use them to solve worded problems  
- construct and transform more complex formulae  
- use function notation to describe simple functions and their inverses  
form composite functions.

Formulae can be used to describe very simple things as well as complicated situations. They can be used to calculate the area of a shape, to decide where best to strike a board to break it or how to launch a rocket into space.

Many real-life calculations rely on formulae. For example, working out how much it will cost to tile rooms of different sizes, converting measurements from one system to another, calculating dosage of medicines for different ages and masses, and calculating how inflation rates will affect profit and loss. Knowing how to work with formulae and how to rearrange them to make the value you are interested in the subject can save you time and money.

In this chapter you will work with more complicated formulae and equations. You will need to be able to rearrange formulae to solve related problems.

You will also revise what you know about functions and learn how to use a more formal mathematical notation to describe functions and their inverses. You will also work with composite functions.

# 22.1 Setting up equations to solve problems

You already know that you can translate word problems into equations using variables to represent unknown quantities. You can then solve the equation to find the solution to the problem.

Working through the problems in Exercise 22.1 will help you remember how to set up equations that represent the sum, difference, product and quotient of quantities and use these to solve problems.

# MATHEMATICAL CONNECTIONS

You used algebra to write expressions and simple equations in Chapter 2. Read through that section again if you have forgotten how to do this.

# Exercise 22.1

1 For each statement, write an equation in terms of  $x$  and then and solve it.

a A number multiplied by four gives 32.  
b If a certain number is multiplied by 12 the result is 96.  
A number added to 12 gives 55.  
d The sum of a number and 13 is 25.  
e When six is subtracted from a certain number, the result is 14.  
If a number is subtracted from nine the result is  $-5$  
g The result of dividing a number by seven is 2.5.  
If 28 is divided by a certain number, the result is four.

2 Represent each situation using an equation in terms of  $y$ . Solve each equation to find the value of  $y$ .

a A number is multiplied by three, then five is added to get 14.  
b When six is subtracted from five times a certain number, the result is 54.  
Three times the sum of a number and four gives 150.  
d When eight is subtracted from half of a number, the result is 27.

3 Solve each problem by setting up an equation.

a When five is added to four times a certain number, the result is 57. What is the number?  
b If six is subtracted from three times a certain number the result is 21. What is the number?  
Four more than a number is divided by three and then multiplied by two to give a result of four. What is the number?  
d A number is doubled and then six is added. When this is divided by four, the result is seven. What is the number?

# TIP

Translating information from words to diagrams or equations is a very useful problem-solving strategy.

# REFLECTION

Reflect on your work in this exercise.

- Which ideas in this work make most sense to you? Why?  
Did you struggle at all? If so, how did you overcome this?  
Why do you think we are studying this objective? How will you use what you have mastered here?

# Solving more complex problems

The problems you solved in Exercise 22.1 involved simple algebraic manipulation. You need to be able to set up equations to solve any problem. To do this, you need to read and make sense of the written problem, represent the situation as an equation and then solve it.

To solve problems by setting up equations:

- Read the problem carefully, paying attention to the words used.  
- Decide what you need to find and what information is already given. It might help to draw a bar model to represent the problem.  
- Ask yourself if there is anything to be assumed or deduced from the given information. For example, if the problem mentions equal lengths and widths of a room can you assume the room is a rectangle? Or, if you are working with a pack of cards, can you assume it is a standard pack with 52 cards?  
- Consider whether there is a formula or mathematical relationship that you can use to connect the information in the problem. For example, if you are asked to find the distance around a round swimming pool, you can use the formula  $C = \pi d$ , or if the problem involves time, distance and speed, you can use the distance-time-speed triangle to form an equation.

# WORKED EXAMPLE 1

My mother was 26 years old when I was born. Now, she is three times as old as I am. What are our ages now?

# Answer

Let my age now be x.

. my mother's age now is 3x.

She is 3 times as old as me.

The difference in ages is 26 years, so:

Mother will always be 26 years older.

$$
\begin{array}{l} 3 x - x = 2 6 \\ \therefore 2 x = 2 6 \\ \therefore x = 1 3 \\ \end{array}
$$

My age now is 13. My mother's age now is 39.

# WORKED EXAMPLE 2

The longest sides of a parallelogram are five times longer than its shorter sides. If it has a perimeter of  $9.6\mathrm{m}$ , what are the lengths of the long and short sides?

# Answer

Let the shorter side be  $x$  metres.  
∴ the longer side is  $5x$ .

![](images/a912a6e4cd308d4bc5ec643ce2cb71e9908a5ee79eb7b0f007bf912645446459.jpg)

$$
\begin{array}{l} 5 x + x + 5 x + x = 9. 6 m \\ 1 2 x = 9. 6 m \\ x = \frac {9 . 6}{1 2} = 0. 8 m \\ \end{array}
$$

So, the shorter side is  $0.8\mathrm{m}$  and the longer side is  $5\times 0.8 = 4\mathrm{m}$

# Heart rates

In medicine, cardiac output (C) is the amount of blood (millilitres) that your heart pumps through your body in a minute. You can work out your own cardiac output using the equation  $C = V \times R$ . V represents the stroke volume, which is the amount of blood your heart pumps each time it beats, and R represents your heart rate, the number of times your heart beats in a minute.

1 Explain why C, V and R are all rates.  
2 Work with a partner to determine your own resting heart rate (R). You can do this by taking each other's pulses for 10 seconds and using that to the number of heart beats per minute. If you have a fitness device, it may work out your resting heart rate for you.

# TIP

Always say what the variables represent.

# INVESTIGATION CONTINUED

3 a Use a mean stroke volume of 80ml/beat and your own heart rate to determine your cardiac output.  
b Zef has a heartrate of 55 beats per minute and a stroke volume of  $92\mathrm{cm}^3$ . How does Zef's cardiac output compare with yours?  
c Najwa has the same cardiac output as Zef with a stroke volume of  $59\mathrm{cm}^3$ . Calculate Najwa's heart rate.

4 Given that  $C = V \times R$  is a directly proportionate relationship, describe what happens to your cardiac output for both an increase and a decrease in heart rate.  
5 Heart specialists sometimes have to consider the resistance of blood flow through a particular blood vessel. They use the formula  $R = \frac{1}{r^4}$  to work this out. In this formula,  $R$  is the resistance of the blood flow and  $r$  is the radius of the blood vessel it flows through.

a What type of relationship is this? Why?  
b A muscular artery has a diameter of  $10\mathrm{mm}$  the vena cavae vein has a diameter of  $15\mathrm{mm}$  and an arteriole has a diameter of  $2\mathrm{mm}$  Calculate  $R$  for each type of blood vessel (ignore the units).  
c What happens to the resistance of blood flow as vessel diameter decreases?  
Why is narrowing of the arteries a health concern? (You may need to do some research to answer this fully.)

# Deriving quadratic equations

To solve some word problems you might need to derive and solve a quadratic equation. Before you can solve the equation you must write the word problem using equations. You may need to use geometry, number facts, probability or any other appropriate techniques that relate to the topic you are working with.

# WORKED EXAMPLE 3

The product of two consecutive integers is 42. Form and solve a quadratic equation to find both possible pairs of integers.

# Answer

Use the letter  $n$  to represent the smaller of the two numbers. Then the larger of the two numbers is  $n + 1$ .

The product of the two numbers is 42, so

$$
\begin{array}{l} n (n + 1) = 4 2 \\ \Rightarrow n ^ {2} + n = 4 2 \\ \Rightarrow n ^ {2} + n - 4 2 = 0 \\ \Rightarrow (n + 7) (n - 6) = 0 \\ \Rightarrow n = - 7 \text {o r} n = 6 \\ \end{array}
$$

$$
\text {I f} n = - 7, \text {t h e n} n + 1 = - 6.
$$

Check: -7 and -6 are consecutive integers and  $-6 \times -7 = 42$ .

$$
\text {I f} n = 6, \text {t h e n} n + 1 = 7.
$$

Check: 6 and 7 are consecutive integers and  $6 \times 7 = 42$ .

So the pairs of integers are 6, 7 and -7, -6.

# WORKED EXAMPLE 4

The length of a rectangle is  $2\mathrm{cm}$  greater than its width. The area of the rectangle is  $15\mathrm{cm}$ . Find its perimeter.

# Answer

![](images/c77054437f47229412c8d8dec25f216b20cc2423871f07a1943518389589d59e.jpg)

Always draw a diagram to show the information and to help you visualise the situation.

The area is the length  $\times$  width, so

$$
\begin{array}{l} x (x + 2) = 1 5 \\ \Rightarrow x ^ {2} + 2 x = 1 5 \\ \Rightarrow x ^ {2} + 2 x - 1 5 = 0 \\ \Rightarrow (x + 5) (x - 3) = 0 \\ \Rightarrow x = - 5 \text {o r} x = 3 \\ \end{array}
$$

$x$  is the width of the rectangle,

so it cannot be a negative number.

This means  $x$  must be 3.

The dimensions of the rectangle are

$$
3 \mathrm {c m} \times 5 \mathrm {c m}.
$$

Its perimeter  $= 3 + 5 + 3 + 5 = 16\mathrm{cm}$

Use  $x$  to represent the width of the rectangle. This means that the length will be  $x + 2$

# WORKED EXAMPLE 5

A right-angled triangle has height  $h$  cm and base  $b$  cm. The hypotenuse of the triangle has length  $\sqrt{13}$  cm. If the area of the triangle is  $3$  cm² find the possible values for  $b$  and  $h$ .

# Answer

Use the formula for the area of a triangle:

$$
\begin{array}{l} \frac {1}{2} b h = 3 \\ \Rightarrow b h = 6 \\ \Rightarrow h = \frac {6}{b} \tag {1} \\ \end{array}
$$

Now use Pythagoras' theorem and the fact that the hypotenuse has length  $\sqrt{13}$  cm:

$$
b ^ {2} + h ^ {2} = 1 3 \tag {2}
$$

Substitute [1] into [2]:

$$
\begin{array}{l} b ^ {2} + \left(\frac {6}{b}\right) ^ {2} = 1 3 \\ \Rightarrow b ^ {2} + \frac {3 6}{b ^ {2}} = 1 3 \\ \end{array}
$$

# TIP

Where possible, make one unknown the subject of the equation, so that it can be substituted into any later equation.

# WORKED EXAMPLE 5 CONTINUED

Solve the equation to find the values of  $b$  and substitute into (1) to find the values of  $h$ :

$$
\begin{array}{l} (b ^ {2}) ^ {2} + 3 6 = 1 3 b ^ {2} \\ \Rightarrow (b ^ {2}) ^ {2} - 1 3 (b ^ {2}) + 3 6 = 0 \\ \Rightarrow \quad (b ^ {2} - 9) (b ^ {2} - 4) = 0 \\ \Rightarrow \quad b = 3 \text {o r} 2 \\ \Rightarrow \quad h = 2 \text {o r} 3 \\ \end{array}
$$

# 22.2 Using and rearranging formulae

You already know that the variable which is written alone on one side of the  $\mathbf{\Pi } = \mathbf{\Pi }$  sign (usually the left) of a formula is called the subject of the formula. For example, in the formula for finding the circumference of a circle,  $C = \pi d$  ,  $C$  is the subject of the formula. This means that it is very easy to find the value of  $C$  if you know the diameter of the circle.

In some situations it is more helpful to have a different variable as the subject, so you will need to rearrange the formula.

To change the subject of a formula:

expand to get rid of any brackets if necessary  
use inverse operations to isolate the variable required.

# WORKED EXAMPLE 6

Solve for  $h$  if  $A = 2\pi r(r + h)$

Answer

$$
\begin{array}{l} A = 2 \pi r (r + h) \\ A = 2 \pi r ^ {2} + 2 \pi r h \\ A - 2 \pi r ^ {2} = 2 \pi r h \\ \end{array}
$$

Expand to remove the brackets.

Subtract to isolate the term with  $h$  in it.

$$
\frac {(A - 2 \pi r ^ {2})}{2 \pi r} = h
$$

Divide to get rid of  $2\pi r$  on the right-hand side.

$$
h = \frac {(A - 2 \pi r ^ {2})}{2 \pi r}
$$

Express the formula in terms of  $h$ .

# Formulae containing squares and square roots

Some formulae have squared terms and square roots. You need to remember that a squared number has both a negative and a positive root when you solve these equations.

TIP

$\sqrt{x}$  means the positive square root only, so  $\sqrt{9}$  is equal to 3.

However, if  $x^2 = 9$  then  $x = \pm \sqrt{9} = \pm 3$ . You must use  $\pm$  when undoing a square.

# WORKED EXAMPLE 7

Make  $x$  the subject of the formula  $ax^2 = b$ .

Answer

$$
a x ^ {2} = b
$$

$$
x ^ {2} = \frac {b}{a}
$$

Divide both side by a.

$$
x = \pm \sqrt {\frac {b}{a}}
$$

Take square root of both sides to get  $x$ .

# WORKED EXAMPLE 8

Given  $r = \sqrt{\frac{A}{\pi}}$  express the formula in terms of A.

Answer

$$
r = \sqrt {\frac {A}{\pi}}
$$

$$
r ^ {2} = \frac {A}{\pi}
$$

Square both sides to get rid of the square root.

$$
\pi r ^ {2} = A
$$

Multiply each side by  $\pi$ .

$$
A = \pi r ^ {2}
$$

TIP

If you are told to solve for  $x$ , or find  $x$ , it means the same as 'make  $x$  the subject of the formula'.

The time it takes a pendulum to swing back and forth (period) does not depend on the mass of the pendulum bob or on how far the pendulum swings, it depends on the length of the pendulum.

The equation for the period  $(T)$  of a simple pendulum is  $T = 2\pi \sqrt{\frac{L}{g}}$ , where  $L$  is the length of the pendulum and  $g$  is the acceleration due to gravity.

The frequency  $(F)$  of a pendulum is the number of times it swings all the way back and forth in one second (expressed in swings per second). Frequency is the inverse of period, or  $\frac{1}{T}$ , so you can rearrange the formula to get  $L = \frac{g}{4\pi^2F^2}$ .

You can use this equation to calculate the length of a pendulum for a given frequency. This is the principle behind the metronome that musicians use to help them play music at the right speed. Find out more about how pendulums are used in daily life.

# Formulae where the subject appears in more than one term

When the variable that is to be the subject occurs more than once, you need to collect the like terms and factorise before you can express the formula in terms of that variable.

Answer

$$
m = 6 - \frac {1 2}{p}

$$
m p = 6 p - 1 2
$$

$$
m p - 6 p = - 1 2

# 22.3 Functions and function notation

A function is a rule or set of instructions for changing one number (the input) into another number (the output). If  $y$  is a function of  $x$ , then the value of  $y$  depends on the values you use for  $x$ . In a function, there is only one possible value of  $y$  for each value of  $x$ .

# Function notation

Function notation is a mathematical way of writing equations (functions). Function notation is widely used in computer applications and also in technical fields.

You already know that a function can be represented in a number of ways. For example, you can show the function  $y = 4x - 1$  using:

a function machine (flow diagram): Input  $\rightarrow \boxed{\times 4}\rightarrow \boxed{-1}\rightarrow$  output  
a mapping diagram:

![](images/8e6298c215f2081860c35738acdaaa89ccee0fac30fe20c873ce9559d2bcea0f.jpg)

a table of values:

<table><tr><td>x</td><td>1</td><td>2</td><td>3</td></tr><tr><td>y</td><td>3</td><td>7</td><td>11</td></tr></table>

a set of  $x$  and  $y$  -values (coordinates):  $\{(1,3),(2,7),(3,11),(4,15)\}$  In set notation this is written as  $\{(x,y):y = 4x - 1\}$  
a graph:

![](images/d9240c88d0f570e14d94aa661a8c349a154466838c6a070bc700f33c5cfe1f4c.jpg)

When you write the equation  $y = 4x - 1$  in function notation it becomes  $f(x) = 4x - 1$ .

You read  $\mathrm{f}(x)$  as 'the function of  $x$ ' or 'f of  $x$ '.

![](images/40ad46a59b4e557c4052f4461e89154c300cbac65c09fd4b30c246f17a8e1f39.jpg)

If  $f(x) = 4x - 1$ , then  $f(5)$  means the value of the function when  $x = 5$ .

In other words,  $f(5) = 4 \times 5 - 1 = 19$ .

Similarly.  $f(-2) = 4 \times -2 - 1 = -9$ .

The number  $4x - 1$  is sometimes called the image of  $x$  (under function  $f$ ).

When a problem involves two or more functions, you use different letters to represent them. For example, you could have:

$$
g (x) = x ^ {2} - 2 x + 3 \text {a n d} h (x) = 5 x - 3
$$

You can show the steps you take to work out the value of any function  $f(x)$  using a simple flow diagram. For example, you can represent the function  $h(x) = 5x - 3$  as:

$$
x - \boxed {x 5} - \boxed {- 3} \rightarrow 5 x - 3
$$

The function  $j(x) = 5(x - 3)$  can be represented as:

$$
x \rightarrow \boxed {- 3} \rightarrow \boxed {\times 5} \rightarrow 5 (x - 3)
$$

Note that the flow charts show the same operations but, as they are done in a different order, they produce different results.

2 Investigate how you can use mathematical functions involving the length of a shadow and time to determine the height of tall objects such as trees or buildings. Share your ideas and findings with your group.

# TIP

In function notation you leave out the  $y$  and replace it with the notation  $f(x)$ . So, if  $f$  is a function and  $x$  is an input, then  $f(x)$  is the output when  $f$  is applied to  $x$ .

# Domain and range

A function is defined by a rule that provides the output values for corresponding input values.

The domain (D) of a function is the set of input values. These are the possible values for the independent variable (the  $x$ -values).

The range (R) is the set of output values from the rule. These are the  $y$ -values, which are dependent on the variable input.

There may be restrictions on the domain. For example, if you are working with time or distance, the input values cannot be negative. Restrictions on the domain may be given with the function. For example  $y = 2x + 3$  where  $x > 1$ . This tells you that you are only interested in values of  $y$  where  $x$  is greater than 1, so the domain is  $x > 1$ .

# TIP

# Remember:

You cannot divide by 0.  
The square root of a negative number is not a real number.  
The square root sign  $(\sqrt{})$  refers to the positive square root only.

# WORKED EXAMPLE 14

Determine the domain and range of each function.

a  $y = \sqrt{2x - 1}$

3x b y=2x+1

# Answers

a  $y = \sqrt{2x - 1}$

Domain:  $y$  will not be a real number if  $(2x - 1)$  is negative.

$2x - 1\geq 0$  (must be positive)

# WORKED EXAMPLE 14 CONTINUED

$$
\begin{array}{l} 2 x \geqslant 1 \\ x \geqslant \frac {1}{2} \quad \text {S o}, x \text {v a l u e s} \text {m u s t} \text {b e g r e a t e r} \text {t h a n} \text {o r} \text {e q u a l} \text {t o} \frac {1}{2}. \\ \end{array}
$$

$$
\text {D o m a i n :} \left\{x: x \geqslant \frac {1}{2} \right\}
$$

Range: The  $\sqrt{}$  sign means only positive square roots.

So,  $y$  must be 0 or greater than 0.

$$
\text {R a n g e :} \{y: y \geqslant 0 \}
$$

$$
b y = \frac {3 x}{2 x + 1}
$$

$$

$$

To find the range we need to work out for which values of  $y, x$  will be undefined.

$$
\begin{array}{l} 2 x y + y = 3 x \quad \text {R e a r r a n g e} \\ 2 x y - 3 x = - y \\ x (2 y - 3) = - y \quad \text {F a c t o r i s e} \\ \mathrm {S o}, x = \frac {- y}{2 y - 3} \quad \text {M a k e} x \text {t h e s u b j e c t} \\ x \text {i s} (2 y - 3) = 0, \\ 3 = 2 y \\ y = \frac {3}{2} \\ \text {R a n g e :} \left\{y: y \neq \frac {3}{2} \right\} \\ \end{array}

# Composite functions

A composite function is a combination of two or more functions. If you have two functions, the composite function is the result of making the output of the first function, the input of the second function. You can think of this as:

Input  $\rightarrow$  [function 1]  $\rightarrow$  output of function 1  $\rightarrow$  [function 2]  $\rightarrow$  output

Look at these two functions:  $f(x) = 2x + 1$  and  $g(x) = x^2$ .

You can apply function f followed by function g to find the composite func. For the input  $x = 4$ :

$$
f (4) = 2 (4) + 1 = 8 + 1 = 9
$$

$$
(9 \text {i s t h e r e s u l t o f t h e f i r s t f u n c t i o n .})
$$

$$
\mathrm {g} (9) = 9 ^ {2} = 8 1
$$

$$
\text {(T h e f u n c t i o n g h a s b e e n a p p l i e d t o t h e r e s u l t .)}
$$

You can write what has been done as  $g[f(4)] = 81$ . However, normally the square brackets are left out and you just write  $g f(4) = 81$ .

$\mathbf{gf}(x)$  is a composite function.

The order of the letters in a composite function is important:

$$
\operatorname {g f} (4) \neq \operatorname {f g} (4)
$$

$\operatorname{fg}(x)$  means do f first then g, but  $\operatorname{fg}(x)$  means do g first then f.

So, the function closest to the  $x$  is applied first.

You can also find an algebraic expression for the composite function  $\operatorname{gf}(x)$ :

$$
\mathrm {f} (x) = 2 x + 1
$$

$(2x + 1$  is the result of the first function.)

$$
\mathrm {g} (2 x + 1) = (2 x + 1) ^ {2}
$$

$$
= 4 x ^ {2} + 4 x + 1
$$

(The function  $\mathbf{g}$  has been applied to the result.)

$$
\operatorname {S o}, \operatorname {g f} (x) = 4 x ^ {2} + 4 x + 1 \text {a n d} \operatorname {g f} (4) = 4 \times 4 ^ {2} + 4 \times 4 + 1 = 6 4 + 1 6 + 1 = 8 1
$$

# Inverse functions

The inverse of any function (f) is the function that will do the opposite of f. In other words, the function that will undo the effects of f. So, if f maps 4 onto 13, then the inverse of f will map 13 onto 4.

In effect, when  $f$  is applied to a number and the inverse of  $f$  is applied to the result, you will get back to the number you started with.

In simple cases, you can find the inverse of a function by inspection. For example, the inverse of  $x \to x + 5$  must be  $x \to x - 5$  because subtraction is the inverse of addition; to undo add five you have to subtract five.

Similarly, the inverse of  $x \to 2x$  is  $x \to \frac{x}{2}$ , because to undo multiply by two you have to divide by two.

The inverse of the function (f) is written as  $\mathsf{f}^{-1}$

So, if  $f(x) = x + 5$ , then  $f^{-1}(x) = x - 5$ .

and, if  $g(x) = 2x$ , then  $g^{-1}(x) = \frac{x}{2}$ .

Some functions do not have an inverse. Think about the function  $x \to x^2$ . This is a function because for every value of  $x$ , there is only one value of  $x^2$ . The inverse (in other words, the square root) is not a function because a positive number has two square roots, one negative, and one positive.

# MATHEMATICAL CONNECTIONS

You briefly worked with inverse functions in trigonometry in Chapter 15.

# Finding the inverse of a function

There are two methods of finding the inverse:

Method 1: using a flow diagram.

In this method you draw a flow diagram for the function and then work out the inverse by 'reversing' the flow to undo the operations in the boxes.

Method 2: reversing the mapping.

In this method you use the fact that if  $f$  maps  $x$  onto  $y$ , then  $f^{-1}$  maps  $y$  onto  $x$ .

To find  $f^{-1}$  you have to find a value of  $x$  that corresponds to a given value of  $y$ .

Worked examples 17-20 show how to find the inverse for two functions, first using method 1 and then using method 2.

# WORKED EXAMPLE 17

Find the inverse of  $f(x) = 3x - 4$ .

# Answer

Using method 1, the flow diagram, you get:  $f \colon$  input  $\rightarrow \boxed{\times 3} \rightarrow \boxed{-4} \rightarrow$  output

Reversing the diagram gives:  $f^{-1}$ : output  $\leftarrow \boxed{+3} \leftarrow \boxed{+4} \leftarrow \text{input}$

Let  $x$  be the input to  $f^{-1}:\frac{x + 4}{3}\gets \boxed{+3}\gets \boxed{+4}\gets x$

$$
S _ {0}, f ^ {- 1} (x) = \frac {x + 4}{3}
$$

# WORKED EXAMPLE 18

Given  $g(x) = 5 - 2x$  find  $g^{-1}(x)$

# Answer

Using method 1, the flow diagram, you get:  $g \colon \text{input} \to \boxed{\times(-2)} \to \boxed{+5} \to \text{output}$

Reversing the diagram gives:  $g^{-1}$ : output  $\leftarrow \boxed{+(-2)} \leftarrow \boxed{-5} \leftarrow \text{input}$

Let  $x$  be the input to  $g^{-1}:\frac{x - 5}{-2}\gets \boxed{+(-2)}\gets \boxed{-5}\gets x$

$$
S _ {0}, g ^ {- 1} (x) = \frac {x - 5}{- 2} = \frac {5 - x}{2}
$$

# WORKED EXAMPLE 19

Find the inverse of the function  $f(x) = 3x - 4$ .

# Answer

Using method 2, reversing the mapping.

$$
y = 3 x - 4
$$

Suppose the function maps  $x$  onto  $y$  (  $y$  is the subject).

$$
y + 4 = 3 x
$$

Make  $x$  the subject of the formula, so that  $y$  maps onto  $x$ .

$$
x = \frac {y + 4}{3}
$$

You know that  $f^{-1}$  maps  $y$  onto  $x$ , so  $f^{-1}(y) = \frac{y + 4}{3}$ .

This is usually written in terms of  $x$  so,  $f^{-1}(x) = \frac{x + 4}{3}$

# WORKED EXAMPLE 20

Given  $g(x) = 5 - 2x$ , find  $g^{-1}(x)$ .

# Answer

Let  $y = 5 - 2x$  This means g maps x onto y.

$2x = 5 - y$  Make  $x$  the subject of the formula, so that  $y$  maps onto  $x$

$$
x = \frac {5 - y}{2}
$$

g-1 maps y onto x, so g-1(y) =  $\frac{5 - y}{2}$

This is usually written in terms of  $x$  so,  $g^{-1}(x) = \frac{5 - x}{2}$

# SUMMARY

# Do you know ...?

When you set up your own equations to represent problems you need to state what the variables stand for.

You can rearrange formulae to make any of the variables the subject. This is called changing the subject of the formula. It may also be called solving the formula for  $(x)$  or expressing the formula in terms of  $(x)$ .

A function is a rule for changing one variable into another.

Functions are written using notation of  $\mathrm{f}\left( x\right)  = x + 2$  .

You can use a flow diagram to represent the steps in a function.

A composite function is a function of a function. The order of a composite function is important  $\operatorname{fg}(x)$  means do g first then f.

An inverse function is function that undoes the original function. It is the reverse of the function.

The photograph on the previous page shows traditional kente cloth from Ghana. The fabric designer has repeated shapes by moving them and turning them in regular ways. You may remember that a change in the position or size of a shape is called a transformation. Choose one or two of the shapes and tell your partner how they have been transformed in this fabric design.

Transformation geometry deals with moving or changing shapes in set ways. You are going to revise what you know about transformations, use vectors, and work with more precise mathematical descriptions of transformations.

# 23.1 Simple plane transformations

Transformation means change. In mathematics, a transformation is a change in the position or size of an object (or point). In this section you will deal with four types of transformations:

- reflection (a flip or mirror image)  
rotation (a turn)  
translation (a slide movement)  
enlargement (making the object larger or smaller).

Slide

A transformation produces an image of the original object in a new position or at a different size. A point,  $P$ , on the object is labelled as  $P'$  on the image.

Reflections, rotations and translations change the position of an object, but they do not change its size. So, the object and its image are congruent. If you place the object and its image on top of each other, they coincide exactly.

When you enlarge an object, you change its size. The object and its image are similar. In other words, the lengths of corresponding sides on the image are in the same proportion as on the object and the corresponding angles on the object and its image are equal.

# Reflection

A reflection is a mirror image of the shape. The line of reflection is called the mirror line. Corresponding points on the object and the image are the same distance from the mirror line. These distances are always measured perpendicular to the mirror line. (In other words, the mirror line is the perpendicular bisector of the distance between any point and its image.) You can see this on the following diagrams.

# LINK

Photographers need to think about reflections, rotations and enlargements when taking and processing photographs. The combination of symmetries in a photograph can often determine the quality of the work.

# MATHEMATICAL CONNECTIONS

You learnt about congruency and similarity in Chapter 11 and you dealt with lines of symmetry (mirror lines) in Chapter 19. You will use these concepts again in this chapter.

To fully define a reflection, you need to give the equation of the mirror line.

# Properties of reflection

A point and its image are equidistant from the mirror line  $(m)$  after reflection about the line  $m$  
The mirror line bisects the line joining a point and its image at right angles.  
A line segment and its image are equal in length.  $AB = A'B'$  
A line and its image are equally inclined to the mirror line. angle  $AOM =$  angle  $A^{\prime}OM$  
- Points on the mirror line are their own images and are invariant.  
Under reflection, a figure and its image are congruent.

# TIP

Note that we usually draw the mirror line as a dashed line.

# TIP

You need  $^ \text{加}$  o be able to work with reflections in horizontal and vertical lines only.

# TIP

Invariant means a point, or a line, remains unchanged in its position and size.

# WORKED EXAMPLE 1

Reflect triangle ABC about the mirror line.

![](images/692cfa1c805aa3848b61c2a4816ca2d8d25689ffae655df2a788a6962d59fa73.jpg)

In the diagram,  $A$  is 1 unit from the mirror line, so its image  $A^{\prime}$  is also 1 unit from the mirror line. Point  $B$  is 2 units from the mirror line, so its image  $B^{\prime}$  is also 2 units from the mirror line. This is also true for  $C$  and its image  $C^{\prime}$ .

The reflection of a straight line is a straight line. So, to obtain the reflection of triangle ABC, join  $A^\prime$  to  $B^{\prime}$ $B^{\prime}$  to  $C^\prime$  and  $C^\prime$  to  $A^\prime$

# TIP

When the mirror line is one of the grid lines it is simple to reflect any point. You count the squares from the point to the mirror line and the reflection is the same distance the other side of the mirror line.

# WORKED EXAMPLE 2

a The mirror line must be the same distance from corresponding points on A and A'.  
b The mirror line is parallel to the y-axis. The  $x$ -value of any point on it is 4, so the equation of the line is  $x = 4$ .

# Rotation

A rotation is a turn around a fixed point. Rotation occurs when an object is turned around a given point. Rotation can be clockwise or anti-clockwise. The fixed point is called the centre of rotation and the angle through which the shape is rotated is called the angle of rotation.

In this diagram, the object has been rotated  $90^{\circ}$  clockwise about the centre of rotation (a vertex of the object).

![](images/cfbdada898c0f13f935d357b2e41b939fc367cddd2366ab1ad083284d6b8feef.jpg)

# Properties of rotation

A rotation through  $180^{\circ}$  is a half turn; a rotation through  $90^{\circ}$  is a quarter turn.  
A point and its image are equidistant from the centre of rotation.  
Each point of an object moves along the arc of a circle whose centre is the centre of rotation. All the circles are concentric:

![](images/79163fd3720f2a327ccf91aee8d5dc68494ae604ff58ff1898c74f8d4c40f39b.jpg)

Only the centre of rotation is invariant.  
The object and the image are congruent after rotation.

# MATHEMATICAL CONNECTIONS

You dealt with rotation when you studied rotational symmetry in Chapter 19.

![](images/efb7838c0eb4836f606aea41de360583a478eefd0b5e0a6f48605130e72fae15.jpg)

To describe a rotation you need to give:

the centre of rotation  
the amount of turn  $(90^{\circ},180^{\circ}$  or  $270^{\circ}$  
the direction of the turn (clockwise or anti-clockwise).

You can use thin paper or tracing paper to help you with rotations:

1 Trace the shape and label the vertices.  
2 Place the tracing over the object.  
3 Use the point of a pair of compasses or pen to hold the paper at the point (centre) of rotation.  
4 Turn the paper through the given turn.  
5 The new position of the shape is the image.

# TIP

The centre of rotation will normally be the origin (0, 0), a vertex of the shape or the midpoint of a side of the shape. The amount of turn will normally be a multiple of  $90^{\circ}$ .

# WORKED EXAMPLE 4

# REFLECTION

# Identifying the reasons for mistakes

Research shows that mistakes are often related to misconceptions or misunderstanding and that simply finding and correcting mistakes does not help to prevent similar mistakes in the future.

Identify any mistakes you made in this exercise.  
- Analyse why you made these mistakes. Decide if you were careless or whether you misunderstood any of the concepts.  
- Suggest one thing you will do so that you don't make similar mistakes in the future.

# Translation

A translation, or slide, is the movement of an object over a specified distance along a line. The object is not twisted or turned. The movement is indicated by positive or negative signs according to the direction of movement along the axes of a plane. For example, movements to the left or down are negative and movements to the right or up are positive.

You can describe a translation using a column vector:  $\binom{x}{y}$ . This means a movement of  $x$  units in the  $x$ -direction (left or right) and a movement of  $y$  units in the  $y$ -direction (up or down). So, for example, a translation of  $\binom{2}{-3}$  means the object moves two units to the right and three units down.

In this diagram, the triangle T is translated to five positions. Each translation is described below the diagram:

![](images/e2ca989687abafeb54ebbaf9456f9e2ac3e6df5d9983fe6ca17d1c3a73c684d0.jpg)

# MATHEMATICAL CONNECTIONS

You will deal with vectors in more detail later in this chapter.

Position 1  $\left( \begin{array}{l}7\\ 0 \end{array} \right)$

Position 2  $\begin{array}{r}\left( \begin{array}{l}0\\ 4 \end{array} \right) \end{array}$

Position 3  $\left( \begin{array}{l} - 7\\ 0 \end{array} \right)$

Position 4  $\left( \begin{array}{l}0\\ -8 \end{array} \right)$

Position 5  $\binom{7}{-8}$

# Properties of translation

A translation moves every point in an object the same distance in the same direction, so you can describe the translation of the whole object by describing the translation of any one point.  
To specify the translation, give both the distance and direction of the translation using a column vector  $\binom{x}{y}$ .  
No part of the object is invariant.  
The object and the image are congruent.

# TIP

Be careful when writing column vectors. There is no dividing line, so they should not look like fractions.

Write  $\binom{3}{8}$  rather

than  $\left(\frac{3}{8}\right)$  they mean different things.

# Exercise 23.3

6 A rectangle  $MNOP$  with vertices  $M(1,6),N(6,6),O(6,3)$  and  $P(1,3)$  is transformed by the translation  $\binom{-3}{2}$  to produce rectangle  $M^{\prime}N^{\prime}O^{\prime}P^{\prime}$

a Represent this translation accurately on a set of axes.  
b Give the coordinates of the vertices of the image.

# Enlargement

When you enlarge a shape, you make it bigger (or smaller). In an enlargement the lengths of sides on the object are multiplied by a constant scale factor  $(k)$  to form the image. The sizes of angles do not change during an enlargement, so the object and its image are similar. To find the scale factor, you use the ratio of corresponding sides on the object and the image:

$$
\text {S c a l e} = \frac {\text {i m a g e} \text {l e n g t h}}{\text {o r i g i n a l} \text {l e n g t h}}
$$

If the scale factor is given, you can find the lengths of corresponding sides by multiplication.

This diagram shows a square which has been enlarged by a scale factor of 1.5.

This means that  $\frac{\text{side } B}{\text{side } A} = 1.5$ .

![](images/a95de72af065b55d27904d34c7fa39e82d4d0785a1652f0b119cc96fb07a7750.jpg)

When an object is enlarged from a fixed point, it has a centre of enlargement. The centre of enlargement determines the position of the image. Lines drawn through corresponding points on the object and the image will meet at the centre of enlargement. You can see this in the diagram below.

You can determine the scale factor by comparing any two corresponding sides, for example:

$$
\frac {A ^ {\prime} B ^ {\prime}}{A B} = \frac {2}{1} = 2,
$$

or by comparing the distances of two corresponding vertices from the origin, for example:

$$
\frac {O C ^ {\prime}}{O C} = 2
$$

'Scale factor' was introduced in Chapter 11. It is the multiplier that tells you how much one shape is larger than another.

# LINK

When you pinch an image on a phone screen to make it bigger you are transforming the image by enlargement.

# Properties of enlargement

The centre of enlargement can be anywhere (inside the object, outside the object or on a vertex or line).  
- A scale factor greater than 1 enlarges the object whilst a scale factor between 0 and 1 reduces the size of the object, although this is still described as an enlargement.  
An object and its image are similar (not congruent) with sides in the ratio  $1:k$  where  $k$  is the scale factor.  
- Angles of the object are invariant.

# TIP

Remember, similar shapes are the same shape but not the same size. Congruent shapes are the same size.

# WORKED EXAMPLE 5

The figure shows quadrilateral ABCD and its image  $A'B'C'D'$  under an enlargement. Find the centre of enlargement and the scale factor.

# Answer

Join the point A and its image A'.

Extend  $AA^{\prime}$  in both directions. Similarly, draw and extend  $BB^{\prime}$ $CC^{\prime}$  and  $DD^{\prime}$

The point of intersection of these lines is the centre of enlargement,  $O$

$$
\begin{array}{l} O A = 2 5 \mathrm {m m} \\ O A ^ {\prime} = 5 0 \mathrm {m m} \\ \end{array}
$$

Scale factor  $= \frac{50}{25} = 2$

Measure OA and OA'.

OA' is twice as long as OA.

# WORKED EXAMPLE 6

# WORKED EXAMPLE 6 CONTINUED

# Answer

Join OA. Continue (produce) the line beyond A.

Measure OA.

Multiply the length of  $OA$  by 2.

Mark the position of  $A^\prime$  on the produced line so that  $OA^{\prime} = 2OA$

Repeat for the other vertices.

# WORKED EXAMPLE 7

Draw  $A'B'C'D'$ , the image of ABCD under an enlargement by a scale factor of  $\frac{1}{3}$  through the origin.

![](images/790a3fde8bb412d77c9770a2b2545719ae5e11bcaf0c6609ca14954287f008a3.jpg)

# Answer

A scale factor of  $\frac{1}{3}$  means the image will be smaller than the object.

Determine the coordinates of each vertex on the image. You can do this by multiplying the  $(x, y)$  coordinates of the vertices on the object by  $\frac{1}{3}$ .

$$
A = (1 2, 1 5), \text {s o} A ^ {\prime} = (4, 5)
$$

$$
B = (9, 6), \text {s o} B ^ {\prime} = (3, 2)
$$

$$
C = (1 8, 6), \text {s o} C ^ {\prime} = (6, 2)
$$

$$
D = (2 1, 9), \text {s o} D ^ {\prime} = (7, 3)
$$

Plot the point and draw and label the enlargement.

# TIP

You can also measure the length of the line from the origin to each vertex on the object and divide those lengths by 3 to determine the position of each vertex on the image. This method is useful when the diagram is not on a coordinate grid.

# 23.2 Further transformations

In addition to the transformations you have already dealt with, you need to be able to reflect an object through any line, rotate an object about any point and use negative scale factors for enlargements. The properties of the object and its image under these transformations are the same as those you already learned.

# WORKED EXAMPLE 8

# Answer

Multiply each set of coordinates by  $-2$

A(1,4), so A'(-2, -8)  
B(3,4), so B'(-6, -8)  
C(3,1), so  $C^{\prime}(-6, - 2)$  
D(1,1), so D'(-2, -2)

Plot the points.

Make sure you label them correctly.

![](images/25e8b6ec1aa2a540308bf047fbcf8eb6238f5ed27a91f87a3c13db07142e7550.jpg)

# TIP

Drawing in the rays from each vertex allows you to check the points on the image are in line with the corresponding ones on the object.

If a point and its image are on opposite sides of the centre of enlargement, then the scale factor is negative.

# Combining transformations

You've already seen that an object can undergo a single transformation to map it to an image. An object can also undergo two transformations in succession. For example, it could be reflected in the  $x$ -axis and then rotated through a quarter turn, or it could be rotated and then reflected in the  $y$ -axis. Sometimes a combined transformation can be described by a single, equivalent transformation.

The following capital letters are conventionally used to represent different transformations:

M Reflection (remember the M is for mirror!)  
R Rotation  
T Translation  
E Enlargement

# WORKED EXAMPLE 11

For the shape P shown in the diagram, let T be the translation  $\binom{2}{1}$  and let M be the reflection in the y-axis.

# 23.3 Vectors

# LINK

The word 'vector' means carrier. In a mathematical context, it is about picking an object up and translating it. In a biological context, animals (including humans) that carry diseases are known as vectors. Rats, birds, mosquitoes and flies are common vectors of disease. The anopheles mosquito is the malaria vector because it carries and spreads the malaria parasite. Houseflies are vectors for a range of microbes that cause gastroenteritis and other diseases in people.

Some quantities are best described by giving both a magnitude (size) and a direction. For example, a wind speed of  $35\mathrm{km / h}$  from the southeast or an acceleration upwards of  $2\mathrm{m / s}^2$ . Force, velocity, displacement and acceleration are all vector quantities.

Other quantities such as time, temperature, speed, mass and area can be described by only giving their magnitude (they don't have a direction). These quantities are called scalars.

A vector is an ordered pair of numbers that you can use to describe a translation. The ordered pair gives both magnitude and direction.

# Vector notation

Vectors can be represented by a directed line segment as shown in the diagrams. Note that the notation is either a small letter with a wavy line beneath it or a bold letter: e.g.  $\mathcal{Q}$  or  $\mathbf{a}$ .

![](images/2504c63c393249160c6da5281f2d9d095f741ea77216e8cc37a88d05cad85f16.jpg)

Vectors can also be represented by a named line such as  $AB$ . In such cases, the vector is denoted by  $\overrightarrow{AB}$ . The order of letters is important because they give the direction of the line.  $\overrightarrow{AB}$  is not the same as  $\overrightarrow{BA}$ .

# Writing vectors as number pairs

Vectors can also be written as a column vector using number pair notation. Look at line  $PQ$  in the diagram.

![](images/567cbf79f922decadc9d9dc5f3d8397ca596a464192e22d69318d1bc806802e9.jpg)

This line represents the translation of  $P$  to  $Q$ . The translation is two units in the positive  $x$ -direction and four units in the positive  $y$ -direction. You can write this as the ordered pair  $\binom{2}{4}$ .

You can therefore write  $\overrightarrow{PQ} = \binom{2}{4}$ .

# WORKED EXAMPLE 12

Express  $\overrightarrow{RS}$  and  $\overrightarrow{LM}$  as column vectors.

![](images/e0eb228b5356b323043df9ff077cfd874bb6d3fa5b1bf6fedfb299a8c15b0483.jpg)

Answer

$$
\overrightarrow {R S} = \binom {3} {4}
$$

Translation from  $R$  to  $S$  is three units right and four up.

$$
\overrightarrow {L M} = \binom {3} {- 2}
$$

Translation from  $L$  to  $M$  is three units right and two down.

# Using vectors to describe a translation

You have already seen that column vectors can be used to describe translations.

In this diagram, triangle  $ABC$  is translated to triangle  $A'B'C'$ . All points on the object have moved two units to the right and three units up, so the column vector that describes this translation is  $\binom{2}{3}$ .

# Equal vectors

Equal vectors have the same size (magnitude) and direction. As vectors are usually independent of position, they can start at any point. The same vector can be at many places in a diagram.

In the diagram,  $\overrightarrow{AB}, \overrightarrow{CD}, \overrightarrow{XY}, \overrightarrow{LM}$  and  $\overrightarrow{RS}$  are equal vectors.

![](images/d902720344b65e4f82e948188a25cd55d851410370fe43dc98ddcb2039b99616.jpg)

$$
\overrightarrow {A B} = \overrightarrow {C D} = \overrightarrow {X Y} = \overrightarrow {L M} = \overrightarrow {R S} = \binom {1} {2}
$$

When equal vectors share a common point, for example when  $\overrightarrow{AB} = \overrightarrow{BC}$  you can deduce that that the points  $A, B$  and  $C$  all lie on a straight line. When points lie on a straight line, they are collinear.

# Multiplying a vector by a scalar

Look at the diagram. Vector  $\overrightarrow{AC}$  is twice as long as vector  $\overrightarrow{AB}$ .

You can say:

$$

Here is another example.

A force, represented by vector  $\mathbf{f}$ , is needed to move a  $1\mathrm{kg}$  concrete block.

If you want to move a  $2\mathrm{kg}$  concrete block, you need to apply twice the force. In other words, you would need to apply  $\mathbf{f} + \mathbf{f}$  or  $2\mathbf{f}$ .

A force of 2f has the same direction as f, but it has twice its magnitude.

Multiplying any vector  $\binom{x}{y}$  by a scalar  $k$ , gives  $k\binom{x}{y} = \binom{kx}{ky}$ .

Vector a multiplied by 2 is the vector 2a. Vector 2a is twice as long as vector a, but they have the same direction. In other words, they are either parallel or in a straight line.

$$
\text {I f} \mathbf {a} = \binom {3} {2} \text {t h e n} 2 \mathbf {a} = 2 \binom {3} {2} = \binom {6} {4}.
$$

Vector a multiplied by -1 is the vector -a, which is opposite in direction to a, but with the same magnitude as a.

# TIP

Remember a scalar is basically just a number. It has magnitude but no direction.

Answer

$$
\frac {1}{4} u = \frac {1}{4} \left( \begin{array}{l} 8 \\ - 4 \end{array} \right) = \left( \begin{array}{l l} \frac {1}{4} \times & 8 \\ \frac {1}{4} \times & - 4 \end{array} \right) = \left( \begin{array}{l} 2 \\ - 1 \end{array} \right)

# Adding vectors

In the diagram, point  $A$  is translated to point  $B$  and then translated again to end up at point  $C$ . However, if you translated the point directly from  $A$  to  $C$ , you end up at the same point. In other words,  $\overrightarrow{AB} + \overrightarrow{BC} = \overrightarrow{AC}$ .

![](images/d499fb3f21ec45a533cea6958e83259e889685514cf62a11135e287903c4b21b.jpg)

You can represent each translation as a column vector:

$$
\overrightarrow {A B} = \binom {3} {1}, \quad \overrightarrow {B C} = \binom {- 2} {2}, \quad \overrightarrow {A C} = \binom {1} {3}
$$

You know that  $\overrightarrow{AB} + \overrightarrow{BC} = \overrightarrow{AC}$ , so:

$$
\binom {3} {1} + \binom {- 2} {2} = \binom {1} {3}
$$

So, to add the vectors, you add the corresponding  $x$ - and  $y$ -coordinates:

$$
\binom {x _ {1}} {y _ {1}} + \binom {x _ {2}} {y _ {2}} = \binom {x _ {1} + x _ {2}} {y _ {1} + y _ {2}}
$$

This is called the 'nose to tail' method or the triangle law.

# LINK

Airline pilots need to consider vectors when landing in a crosswind. The plane can be controlled to move relative to the air, but the air is often also moving in a different direction relative to the ground. The combination of the aircraft and air velocities is important when the pilot determines how to steer the aircraft onto a runway.

# Subtracting vectors

Think again about the three vectors:

$$
\overrightarrow {A B} = \binom {3} {1}, \quad \overrightarrow {B C} = \binom {- 2} {2}, \quad \overrightarrow {A C} = \binom {1} {3}
$$

Subtracting a vector is the same as adding its negative, so:

$$
\overrightarrow {A C} - \overrightarrow {A B} = \overrightarrow {A C} + (- \overrightarrow {A B})
$$

The diagram shows the result of adding  $\overrightarrow{AC}$  and  $-\overrightarrow{AB}$  'nose to tail'. This shows that vector  $\overrightarrow{AC} - \overrightarrow{AB}$  is the same as vector  $\overrightarrow{BC}$ .

$$
\mathrm {S o}, \overrightarrow {A C} - \overrightarrow {A B} = \overrightarrow {B C}
$$

$$
\binom {1} {3} - \binom {3} {1} = \binom {- 2} {2}
$$

![](images/ec759f8e651581d279aaef48d7e467633eebebd560a6c66d33dc7cf30d2da98a.jpg)

To subtract the vectors, you subtract the corresponding  $x$ - and  $y$ -coordinates:

$$
\binom {x _ {1}} {y _ {1}} - \binom {x _ {2}} {y _ {2}} = \binom {x _ {1}} {y _ {1}} + \binom {- x _ {2}} {- y _ {2}} = \binom {x _ {1} - x _ {2}} {y _ {1} - y _ {2}}
$$

# TIP

You could also use the fact that vector  $-\overrightarrow{AB}$  is the same size as  $\overrightarrow{AB}$  but in the opposite direction, so  $-\overrightarrow{AB} = \overrightarrow{BA}$ .

This means that  $\overrightarrow{AC} - \overrightarrow{AB} = \overrightarrow{AC} + \overrightarrow{BA}$

If you rearrange the vectors, you can apply the nose to tail rule method and add them:

$$
\overrightarrow {A C} - \overrightarrow {A B} = \overrightarrow {B A} + \overrightarrow {A C} = \overrightarrow {B C}
$$

# SELF ASSESSMENT

Develop a set of success criteria to assess your understanding of vectors.

1 Draw a table like this one:

<table><tr><td>Success criteria</td><td>Evidence of success</td><td>Improvements</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr></table>

2 Look back at the learning intentions at the start of this chapter. Use these to develop a list of criteria that you can use to decide whether you have met the learning intentions. For example:

I can write a column vector to describe a translation.

3 Once you have your list, check your work against the success criteria.

- Place a tick (✓) in the second column if you can find evidence that you have met each one. (You are looking for how your work shows you have achieved the criteria.)

If you cannot find evidence, write down what you can do to improve in that particular area.

4 Make any improvements that you need to over the next few days and then reassess your work using the same criteria.

# The magnitude of a vector

The magnitude of a vector is its length. You use the notation  $|AB|$  or  $|a|$  to write the magnitude of a vector  $(AB)$ .

You can use Pythagoras' theorem to calculate the magnitude of a vector.

In general, if  $\overrightarrow{AB} = \binom{x}{y}$  then  $\left|\overrightarrow{AB}\right| = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2}$ .

# WORKED EXAMPLE 21

# Position vectors

A vector that starts from the origin  $(O)$  is called a position vector.

In this diagram, point  $A$  has the position vector  $\overrightarrow{OA}$  or a.

If  $\mathbf{a} = \begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ 2 \end{pmatrix}$  then the coordinates of point  $A$  will be (3, 2).

Because the coordinates of the point  $A$  are the same as the components of the column vector  $\binom{3}{2}$  you can use position

vectors to find the magnitude of any vector.

# DISCUSSION

# Perpendicular vectors

Work with a partner. You will need a ruler and squared paper.

1 Draw three different pairs of vectors that are perpendicular to each other.  
2 Use your diagrams to find a general rule for determining whether two vectors are perpendicular.

# SUMMARY

# Do you know ...?

A transformation involves a change in the position and/or size of a shape.

A reflection is a mirror image, a rotation is a turn, a translation is a slide and an enlargement is an increase in size.

To fully describe a reflection you need to give the equation of the mirror line.

To fully describe a rotation you need to give the angle and centre of rotation.

To describe a translation you can use a column vector  $\begin{pmatrix} x \\ y \end{pmatrix}$ .

To describe an enlargement you need to give the scale factor and the centre of enlargement.

A vector has both magnitude and direction. You can add and subtract vectors but you cannot multiply or divide vectors. You can multiply a vector by a scalar.

The magnitude of a vector  $\left( \begin{array}{l}x\\ y \end{array} \right) = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2}$ . You write the magnitude as  $|\overline{XY}|$  or  $|\mathbf{x}|$ .

A position vector is a vector that starts at the origin.

# Probability using tree diagrams and Venn diagrams

# IN THIS CHAPTER YOU WILL:

- use tree diagrams and Venn diagrams to show all possible outcomes of combined events  
calculate the probability of simple combined events using tree diagrams and Venn diagrams.  
- use tree diagrams, Venn diagrams and two-way tables to calculate conditional probability.

The probability of getting heads when you toss one coin is 0.5. But what is the probability of getting heads only when you toss two, three or 20 coins at the same time?

Probability is an important branch of mathematics, but understanding probability is also important in real life, especially for understanding risk and relative risk. For example, if you are told that carrying a particular gene doubles your chances of getting a serious disease, it is important to think about what the probability was in the first place. For example, does doubling the probability mean you have a 2 in 1000000 chance of getting the disease rather than a 1 in 1000000 chance? Because in that case, the probability has doubled, but it is still very low.

In this chapter, you are going to use diagrams to show possible outcomes and calculate the probability of combined events to deepen your understanding of probability concepts.

# GETTING STARTED

1 Here are four statements about probability.

a Read each statement carefully and decide whether it is correct or not.  
b Explain your decisions to a partner.

<table><tr><td>Statement A
Tomorrow it will either be sunny or not sunny. The probability that it will be sunny is 0.5.</td><td>Statement B
In a true or false test with 20 questions, you are certain to get 10 correct if you just guess.</td><td>Statement C
If you roll a fair dice four times, you are more likely to get four different numbers than four sixes in a row.</td><td>Statement D
If you toss a coin five times in a row and the first four tosses are heads your next toss is more likely to be tails.</td></tr></table>

2 Look at this Venn diagram.

What do the letters a, b, c, d and e represent?

3 Look at the three statements in the box.

<table><tr><td>n(A)</td><td>AUB</td><td>ANB</td></tr></table>

a What does each one mean?  
b How would you work out each one from a Venn diagram?

# KEYWORD

conditional probability

# 24.1 Using tree diagrams to show

# outcomes

In Chapter 8 you used sample space diagrams to show the sample space and all possible outcomes for statistical experiments.

If you roll a dice and flip a coin, the sample space diagram could look like this:

<table><tr><td>Dice Coin</td><td>1</td><td>2</td><td>3</td><td>4</td><td>5</td><td>6</td></tr><tr><td>Heads</td><td>H1</td><td>H2</td><td>H3</td><td>H4</td><td>H5</td><td>H6</td></tr><tr><td>Tails</td><td>T1</td><td>T2</td><td>T3</td><td>T4</td><td>T5</td><td>T6</td></tr></table>

These outcomes can also be shown on a tree diagram:

![](images/e0681d928d64fd623c4671c84f8fa739dcb1e7631f167a06e675af27a3e85fa5.jpg)

On a tree diagram the outcomes are written at the end of the branches.

Think about the event 'getting all heads' when you toss a coin three times in a row. You cannot show all the possible outcomes for this on a possibility diagram, but you can show them on a tree diagram as in Worked example 1.

# WORKED EXAMPLE 1

When you toss a coin you can either get heads or tails. Draw a tree diagram to show the possible outcomes for tossing a coin three times. Use H for heads and T for tails.

![](images/087d47dc622d105cf2df18efb782423822f93e5f00cfcd3b023618d2b68ede39.jpg)  
Answer

Draw a dot for the first toss.

Draw and label two branches, one H and one T.

Repeat this at the end of each branch for the second and third coin toss.

# LINK

Any situation where you need to make a decision can lead to a 'tree' like the one shown here. For example, if each weekend you have the choice between going out or staying at home, you create a 'split' into two possibilities. After a few weeks, the tree diagram will show several possible combinations of decisions you could have made.

# Exercise 24.1

1 Sunil has a bag containing three coloured counters: red, blue and green.

a Draw a tree diagram to show the possible outcomes when one counter is drawn from the bag at random, then returned to the bag before another counter is drawn at random.  
b How many possible outcomes are there for the two draws?  
c How many outcomes produce two counters of the same colour?  
d How many outcomes contain at least one blue counter?  
e How many outcomes do not contain the blue counter?

2 Four cards marked A, B, C and D are in a container. A card is drawn, the letter noted, and then it is replaced. Another card is then drawn and the letter noted to make a two-letter combination.

a Draw a tree diagram to show the sample space in this experiment.  
b How many outcomes are in the sample space?  
c What is the probability of getting the letter combination BD?

# 24.2 Calculating probability from tree diagrams

# MATHEMATICAL CONNECTIONS

For independent events  $P(A$  and then  $B) = P(A)\times P(B)$

For mutually exclusive events  $P(A \text{ or } B) = P(A) + P(B)$ .

Read through Chapter 8 again if you have forgotten this.

Here is the tree diagram showing possible outcomes for throwing a dice and tossing a coin at the same time (H is used for head and T is used for tail).

This is the same diagram as the one at the start of Section 24.1, but now the probability of each outcome is written by the side of each branch.

![](images/2060c6cd585b6f9bbca8803687802b57f70ea9879ebd3076481579181d5c65c6.jpg)

# LINK

One particular kind of study of tiny particles is called quantum mechanics. This looks at the probability of finding particles in particular places at particular times.

# The probability of combined events on a tree diagram

To find the probability of one particular combination of outcomes:

- multiply the probabilities on consecutive branches, for example the probability of throwing a 5 and getting an H is  $\frac{1}{6} \times \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{12}$ .

To find the probability when there is more than one favourable combination or when the events are mutually exclusive:

- multiply the probabilities on consecutive branches  
- add the probabilities (of each favourable combination) obtained by multiplication, for example, throwing 1 or 2 and getting an H is

$$
\left(\frac {1}{6} \times \frac {1}{2}\right) + \left(\frac {1}{6} \times \frac {1}{2}\right) = \frac {1}{1 2} + \frac {1}{1 2} = \frac {2}{1 2} = \frac {1}{6}
$$

When you are interested only in specific probabilities, you can draw a tree diagram that only shows the favourable outcomes. For example, if you wanted to find the probability of getting a number  $< 5$  and  $\mathbf{H}$  in the above experiment, you might draw a tree diagram like this one:

$$
P (<   5 \text {a n d} H) = \frac {4}{6} \times \frac {1}{2} = \frac {1}{3}
$$

# MATHEMATICAL CONNECTIONS

You learnt in Chapter 8 that mutually exclusive events cannot both happen together.

# TIP

There are four numbers on a dice that are less than 5. As they are equally likely to occur, the probability of scoring

$$

# WORKED EXAMPLE 3

This tree diagram shows all possible combinations of male and female calves for a cow after three pregnancies.

This assumes that each pregnancy produces one calf and that the outcomes, male or female, are equally likely. Find the probability that:

a at least one calf is female  
b two of the calves are female  
c the first and last born calves are the same sex.

![](images/0651f372763266b16515364cec0f1e823a77df5e4653ef4231b868c5b38de69d.jpg)

# Answers

a P(at least one female) = 7(1/2 × 1/2 × 1/2)

$$
\begin{array}{l} = 7 \times \frac {1}{8} \\ = \frac {7}{8} \\ \end{array}
$$

b P(two are female) = 3/8  
c  $P(\text{first and last same sex}) = \frac{4}{8} = \frac{1}{2}$

All outcomes except MMM have at least one female.

This makes seven outcomes. As each outcome is

$\frac{1}{2} \times \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{1}{2}$  you can simply multiply this by 7.

There are three out of eight outcomes where there are two females.

FFF, FMF, MFM and MMM have the first and last with the same sex. The probability for each combination is  $\frac{1}{8}$ , so you can add the favourable combinations to give  $\frac{4}{8}$ .

# 24.3 Calculating probability from Venn diagrams

You used Venn diagrams to show the relationships between sets in Chapter 9. Now you are going to use Venn diagrams to solve probability problems.

This Venn diagram shows the results of a survey in which people were asked whether they watch programme  $A$  or programme  $B$ . Study the diagram and read the information to see how to determine probabilities from a Venn diagram.

![](images/2af7335642856f6b1e0e004a0e0caf95184c985e1558f021a7a6599e944485e2.jpg)

$\mathcal{E}$  means the universal set. In probability this is the sample space, or set of all possible outcomes. In this example the sample space is  $40 + 30 + 20 + 10 = 100$  people.

$\mathfrak{n}(A)$  means the number of elements in set  $A$

$$
\mathrm {n} (A) = 4 0 + 3 0 = 7 0
$$

$P(A)$  means the probability that an element is in set  $A$ . You can write this as the number of elements in set  $A$  as a fraction of the sample space.

Remember to include the elements in the intersection in set  $A$ .

$$
P (A) = \frac {7 0}{1 0 0} = \frac {7}{1 0} \text {o r} 0. 7 \quad .
$$

$A \cap B$  is the intersection of sets  $A$  and  $B$ . It is the elements shared by  $A$  and  $B$ . You write the probability of the two events happening as  $P(A$  and  $B)$ . This is the same as  $P(A \cap B)$ , the probability that an element is in both set  $A$  and set  $B$ . The word 'and' is a clue that the probability is found in the intersection of the sets.

$$
\mathrm {n} (A \cap B) = 3 0, \text {s o} P (A \cap B) = \frac {3 0}{1 0 0} = \frac {3}{1 0} \text {o r} 0. 3
$$

$A \cup B$  is the union of sets  $A$  and  $B$ . It is the elements in both sets, with none repeated. You write the probability of either event  $A$  happening or event  $B$  happening as  $P(A$  or  $B)$ . This is the same as  $P(A \cup B)$ , the probability that an element is found either in set  $A$  or in set  $B$ . The word 'or' is a clue that the probability is found in the union of the sets.

$$
\ln (A \cup B) = 4 0 + 3 0 + 2 0 = 9 0, \text {s o} P (A \cup B) = \frac {9 0}{1 0 0} = \frac {9}{1 0} \text {o r} 0. 9
$$

When a question contains words like 'is not' or 'neither' it is a clue that you are looking for the complement of a set. For example, 'What is the probability that a person watches neither of the two programmes?' In the Venn diagram this is everything outside of  $A \cup B$ . So,  $P$  (neither  $A$  nor  $B$ ) is  $1 - P(A \cup B)$ .

# TIP

1-  $P(A\cup B)$  is the same as  $P(A\cup B)'$  .The complement of  $A\cup B$

# WORKED EXAMPLE 4

In a survey, 25 people were asked to say if they liked fruit and if they liked vegetables.

15 people said they liked vegetables and 18 said they liked fruit.

a both fruit and vegetables

b either fruit or vegetables

# Answers

Start by defining the sets and writing the information in set language. Use letters to make it quicker and easier to refer to the sets.

$$
\mathcal {E} = \{\text {n u m b e r o f p e o l e s u r v e y e d} \}, n (\mathcal {E}) = 2 5
$$

$$
F = \{\text {p e o p l e w h o l i k e f r u i t} \}, \text {s o} n (F) = 1 8
$$

$$
V = \{\text {p e o p l e w h o l i k e v e g e t a b l e s} \}, \text {s o} n (V) = 1 5
$$

$$
n (F) + n (V) = 1 8 + 1 5 = 3 3
$$

But the total number of people surveyed was only 25.

$33 - 25 = 8$  so 8 people must have said they liked both fruit and vegetables.

$$
n (F \cap V) = 8
$$

Once you've defined the sets, you can draw the diagram.

You don't know the names of the people surveyed, so you have to work with the number of people in each set.

![](images/d396e141d2f78c001f4c6cccc18b93523e6f66410b1bc77bcbbaf78214ee372e.jpg)

a After you have drawn the diagram, calculate the probability.

In words:

$$
P (\text {P e r s o n l i k e s b o t h}) = \frac {\text {n u m b e r o f p e o l e w h o l i k e b o t h}}{\text {n u m b e r o f p e o l e s u r v e y e d}} = \frac {8}{2 5} = 0. 3 2
$$

In set language:

$$
P (F \text {a n d} V) = \frac {n (F \cap V)}{n (\ell)} = \frac {8}{2 5} = 0. 3 2
$$

b  $P(F$  or  $V) = \frac{10}{25} +\frac{8}{25} +\frac{7}{25} = \frac{25}{25} = 1$

This is the same as  $F \cup V$ .

# MATHEMATICAL CONNECTIONS

In Chapter 9 you saw that numbers in Venn diagrams can represent either the elements in a set or the number of elements in a set. In probability, you will usually work with the number of elements in the set.

# WORKED EXAMPLE 5

In a survey, 30 people were asked whether they used the bus, metro or E-hailing providers for public transport. The survey found that 16 people use the bus, 10 use the metro, 8 use E-hail providers, 3 people use all three types, 4 use the bus and the metro only, 3 use the metro and E-hail providers only and 4 use the bus and E-hail providers only.

a Draw a Venn diagram to show the results.

# 24.4 Conditional probability

If the probability of an event depends on the outcome of a previous event then the probability is said to be conditional.

For two events  $A$  and  $B$ ,  $P(B$  given that  $A$  has happened) refers to the conditional probability of  $B$  happening given that  $A$  has already happened.

The way that you work out the conditional probability depends on whether the events are independent or not.

# Independent events

Imagine you roll two normal six-sided dice.

The first dice lands on a 6. What is the probability of the second dice also landing on 6?

These two events are independent. The score on the second dice is not affected by the outcome of the first.

If two events  $A$  and  $B$  are independent, it is always true that

$P(B$  given that  $A$  has happened)  $= P(B)$

so in this case, the probability of getting a 6 with the second dice is  $\frac{1}{6}$ .

# Dependent events

If two events  $A$  and  $B$  are dependent, the first event does affect the probability of the second event.

For example, suppose you have an apple, an orange and a banana and you choose two of the fruits at random. If you choose the apple first, you can only choose between the orange and the banana for your second fruit. The options for your second fruit are dependent on what you chose first because now you only have two fruits left to choose from.

To find the probability of  $B$  given that  $A$  has happened, use the rule:

$$
P (B \text {g i v e n t h a t} A \text {h a s h a p p e n e d}) = \frac {P (A \text {a n d} B)}{P (A)}
$$

When you deal with Venn diagrams, this rule can be written in set language as:

$$
P (B \text {g i v e n t h a t} A \text {h a s h a p p e n e d}) = \frac {P (A \cap B)}{P (A)}
$$

You can use tree diagrams and Venn diagrams to help you solve problems involving conditional probability.

# TIP

When you are using a tree diagram always check whether the probability of an event changes because of the outcome of a previous event. Questions involving conditional probability often contain the instructions 'without replacement' or 'one after the other'.

# WORKED EXAMPLE 6

A bag contains 21 balls. There are 12 blue balls and 9 green balls. Without looking, two balls are removed one after the other, without replacing them.

a Draw a tree diagram to represent the situation.  
b Find the probability that:

both balls are blue (BB)  
ii both balls are green (GG)  
one ball is green and the other is blue.

c A third ball is taken at random. What is the probability that:

i all three balls are blue?  
ii at least one of the balls is green?

# Answers

![](images/6aa0575155729f060daa331057f5fb154e912d8e498d9bd38546fa88b5caabf6.jpg)

This is an example of conditional probability. You cannot choose the same ball twice, so for the second set of branches there are only 20 balls left. If the first ball is blue, there are only 11 blue balls left but still 9 green balls. If the first ball is green, there are only 8 green balls left, but still 12 blue. In each case the numerator of one branch has changed but the numerators still add up to the value of the denominator (as this has also changed).

12 11 11 b i 21 20 35

9 8 6 ii P(GG) 21 20 35  
12 9 12 18 35

The blue and green can be chosen in either order.

c

![](images/029b80aafdc73f0495fbf5f84cc25cec9752273c69afe892ef6a344f0ca5d45c.jpg)

You may find it helpful to add a third set of branches to the diagram, but, if you can see the pattern of the probabilities on the branches, you can just show the arithmetic.

$$
i P (B B B) = \frac {1 2}{2 1} \times \frac {1 1}{2 0} \times \frac {1 0}{1 9} = \frac {2 2}{1 3 3}
$$

ii  $P(\text{at least one green}) = 1 - P(\text{all blue})$

$$
= 1 - \frac {2 2}{1 3 3} = \frac {1 1 1}{1 3 3}
$$

(Sometimes it is faster to work out the probabilities that you don't want and subtract the result from 1.)

# WORKED EXAMPLE 7

In a group of 50 students, 36 students work on tablet computers, 20 work on laptops and 12 work on neither of these.

A student is chosen at random. What is the probability that this student:

a works on a tablet and a laptop computer?  
b works on at least one type of computer?  
c works on a tablet given that he or she works on a laptop?  
d does not work on a laptop, given that he or she works on a tablet?

# Answers

Start by identifying the sets and drawing a Venn diagram.

$T =$  {students who work on tablets}  $n(T) = 36$

$L =$  {students who work on laptops}  $n(L) = 20$

$50 - 12 = 38$  so there are 38 students in  $T$  and  $L$  combined.

$36 + 20 = 56$  , but there are only 38 students in  $T$  and L combined.

$56 - 38 = 18$  so 18 students work on both  $(T\cap L)$

![](images/4f4de40801c65531aa791e7fc66a60feeae6a9f8c614517b9b6711fbe2c766dd.jpg)

a P works on both)  $= P(T\cap L) = \frac{18}{50} = \frac{9}{25}$  
b  $P(\text{works on at least one}) = 1 - P(\text{works on neither}) = 1 - \frac{12}{50} = \frac{38}{50} = \frac{19}{25}$  
c  $P(T$  given that  $L$  has happened)  $= \frac{P(L\text{and}T)}{P(L)} = \frac{n(L\cap T)}{n(L)}$

$$
= \frac {1 8}{2 0} = \frac {9}{1 0}
$$

d P(Not L given T has happened) = P(L' and T) = 18/36 = 1/2

# TIP

$P(T$  given that  $L$  has happened) is dependent on students already using a laptop, so the probability is calculated using the total number of students who use a laptop not the total number of students.  $n(T$  and  $L$  is the number of students in the intersection of the two sets.

# WORKED EXAMPLE 8

# WORKED EXAMPLE 8 CONTINUED

a What is the probability a randomly chosen student uses a phone to access the internet, given that the student is in Grade 11?  
b A student is in Grade 10. What is the probability that the student uses a PC to access the internet?  
c If a randomly chosen student uses a tablet to access the internet, what is the probability they are in Grade 11?

# Answers

<table><tr><td></td><td>Phone</td><td>Tablet</td><td>PC</td><td>Total</td></tr><tr><td>Grade 10</td><td>200</td><td>330</td><td>120</td><td>650</td></tr><tr><td>Grade 11</td><td>250</td><td>320</td><td>80</td><td>650</td></tr><tr><td>Total</td><td>450</td><td>650</td><td>200</td><td></td></tr></table>

Add totals to the table so that you can use them to calculate probabilities.

a

<table><tr><td></td><td>Phone</td><td>Tablet</td><td>PC</td><td>Total</td></tr><tr><td>Grade 10</td><td>200</td><td>330</td><td>120</td><td>650</td></tr><tr><td>Grade 11</td><td>250</td><td>320</td><td>80</td><td>650</td></tr><tr><td>Total</td><td>450</td><td>650</td><td>200</td><td></td></tr></table>

You know the student is in Grade 11, so you only need to look at the values for Grade 11.

P(Phone user given Grade 11) =  $\frac{250}{650} = \frac{5}{13}$

250 out of the 650 students in Grade 11 use a phone to access the internet.

b P(PC user given Grade 10) =  $\frac{120}{650} = \frac{12}{65}$

This time you need to look at the Grade 10 values.

c P(Grade 11 given they use a tablet) =  $\frac{320}{650} = \frac{32}{65}$

You know the student uses a tablet so use the values in the tablet column.

650 students use a tablet and 320 are in Grade 11.

# TIP

Conditional probability involves finding something using something that you know already. So for  $P(A$  given that  $B$  has happened),  $A$  is the event of interest, and  $B$  is the event that we assume has occurred.

# Mathematics Core and Extended

The third edition fully covers both Core and Extended content through the 'spiral' approach, where you build on your previous learning as you progress through the course. In addition to a wealth of practice questions and support for English as a second language learners, we have included a number of projects provided by NRICH – a collaboration between the Faculties of Mathematics and Education at the University of Cambridge – to encourage you to put your theory into practice.

Answers are available to download from Cambridge GO.

Mathematical connections' feature boxes help you make links across different topics whilst working through the chapters of the book.  
- 'Investigation' activities encourage you to extend your learning by investigating a real-life example, or by discussing it with your classmates.  
Project activities created by NRICH help you develop your problem solving and collaboration skills with real-life mathematics.  
- At the end of some exercises you will find opportunities to assess your own work, or that of your classmates, and consider how you can improve.

For more information on how to access and use your digital resource, please see insider the front cover.

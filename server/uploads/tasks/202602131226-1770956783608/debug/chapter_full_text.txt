[806|p27] When you calculate with negative and positive integers, you need to pay attention to the signs and remember these rules:
[807|p27] - Adding a negative number is the same as subtracting the number.  $3 + -5 = -2$
[808|p27] - Subtracting a negative number is the same as adding a positive number.  $3 - - 5 = 8$
[809|p27] Multiplying or dividing the same signs gives a positive answer.  $-3 \times -5 = 15$  and  $-20 \div -4 = -5$
[810|p27] - Multiplying or dividing different signs gives a negative answer.  $3 \times -5 = 15$  and  $15 \div -3 = -5$ .

[1032|p32] Brackets act as grouping symbols. Work out any calculations inside brackets before doing the calculations outside the brackets.
[1033|p32] Root signs work in the same way as a bracket. If you have  $\sqrt{25 + 9}$ , you must add 25 and 9 before finding the root.

[1106|p35] To multiply different powers of the same number, add the indices. For example,  $3^{2} \times 3^{5} = 3^{2 + 5} = 3^{7}$  and  $4^{-2} \times 4^{3} = ...
[1107|p35] To divide different powers of the same number, subtract the indices.

[1109|p35] To find the power of a power you multiply the indices. For example,  $(3^{1})^{2} = 3^{3 \times 2} = 3^{6}$  and  $(4^{2})^{-3} = 4^{2 \times -3} = 4^...

[1112|p35|T1] Zero and negative indices
[1113|p35] Do you remember how to work with zero and negative indices? Read through this information to refresh your memory.
[1114|p35] In this table, each value is  $\frac{1}{5}$  of the one to its left. For example,  $5^4 \div 5 = 5^3$ .
[1115|p35] [Table Row] <tr><td>Power of 5</td><td>54</td><td>53</td><td>52</td><td>51</td><td>50</td><td>5-1</td><td>5-2</td><td>5-3</td><td>5-4</td></tr>
[1116|p35] [Table Row] <tr><td>Value</td><td>625</td><td>125</td><td>25</td><td>5</td><td>1</td><td>1/5</td><td>1/25</td><td>1/125</td><td>1/625</td></tr>
[1117|p35] The pattern in the table shows that  $5^0 = 1$ . This is true for any number to the power of 0.
[1118|p35] We can say  $a^0 = 1$  (where  $a \neq 0$ , because  $0^0$  is undefined.).
[1119|p35] You can also see from the table that a number with a negative index is equal to its reciprocal with a positive index. For example:  $5^{-2} = \frac{1}...
[1120|p35] This is true for all negative indices.
[1121|p35] We can say  $a^{-m} = \frac{1}{a^{m}}$  (where  $a \neq 0$ ).

[1190|p36] Do you remember what a fractional index such as  $5^{\frac{1}{2}}$  means?
[1191|p36] You can use the laws of indices to show the meaning of fractional indices.
[1192|p36] $$
5 ^ {\frac {1}{2}} \times 5 ^ {\frac {1}{2}} = 5 ^ {(\frac {1}{2} + \frac {1}{2})} = 5 ^ {1} = 5
$$
[1193|p36] ou also know that  $\sqrt{5}\times \sqrt{5} = 5$
[1194|p36] $$
\mathrm {S o}, 5 ^ {\frac {1}{2}} = \sqrt {5}
$$
[1195|p36] $$
5 ^ {1} \times 5 ^ {1} \times 5 ^ {1} = 5 ^ {1 + 1 + 1} = 5 ^ {1} = 5
$$
[1196|p36] $$
\text {A n d} \sqrt [ 3 ]{5} \times \sqrt [ 3 ]{5} \times \sqrt [ 3 ]{5} = 5
$$
[1197|p36] $$
\mathrm {S o}, 5 ^ {\frac {1}{2}} = \sqrt [ 3 ]{5}
$$
[1198|p36] In general terms, for unit fractions:
[1199|p36] $$
a ^ {\frac {1}{2}} = \sqrt {a} \quad a ^ {\frac {1}{2}} = \sqrt [ 3 ]{a} \quad a ^ {\frac {1}{2}} = \sqrt [ 3 ]{a}
$$
[1200|p36|T1] LINK
[1201|p36] Fractional indices and roots are used in many different financial calculations involving investments, insurance policies and economic decisions.
[1202|p37] You can use the rule for finding the power of a power to show the meaning of fractional indices where the numerator is not 1 (non-unit fractions).
[1203|p37] $$
(4 \frac {1}{2}) ^ {3} = 4 \frac {1}{4} \times \frac {1}{2}) = 4 \frac {1}{2}
$$
[1204|p37] This shows that a number such as  $5^{\frac{1}{2}}$  can be written with a unit fraction index as  $(5^{\frac{1}{2}})^{2}$ .
[1205|p37] You already know that you can write a unit fraction (such as  $\frac{1}{3}$ ) as a root.
[1206|p37] $$
S _ {0} 5 ^ {\frac {1}{2}} = (5 ^ {\frac {1}{2}}) ^ {2} = (\sqrt [ 3 ]{5}) ^ {2}

[1207|p37] It is simpler to input the value in root form into your calculator than to enter  $5^{\ddagger}$ . In general terms, for non-unit fractions:
[1208|p37] $$
a ^ {\frac {m}{2}} = \left(a ^ {\frac {1}{2}}\right) ^ {m} = \left(\sqrt [ n ]{a}\right) ^ {m} = \sqrt [ n ]{a ^ {m}}

[1268|p38] do division and multiplication next, working from left to right.

[1270|p38] Many people use the letters BODMAS to remember the order of operations.

[1273|p38] Orders
[1274|p38] Divide Multiply
[1275|p38] Add Subtract
[1276|p38] BODMAS indicates that indices (powers of) are considered after brackets but before all other operations.
[1277|p38|T1] Grouping symbols
[1278|p38] The most common grouping symbols in mathematics are brackets. Here are some examples of the different kinds of brackets used in mathematics:
[1279|p38] $$
\begin{array}{l} (4 + 9) \times (1 0 \div 2) \\ [ 2 (4 + 9) - 4 (3) - 1 2 ] \\ \{2 - [ 4 (2 - 7) - 4 (3 + 8) ] - 2 \times 8 \} \\ \end{array}
$$
[1280|p38|T1] MATHEMATICAL CONNECTIONS
[1281|p38] You will apply the order of operation rules to fractions, decimals and algebraic expressions as you progress through the course.
[1282|p39] When you have more than one set of brackets in a calculation, you work out the innermost set first.
[1283|p39] Other symbols used to group operations are:
[1284|p39] - fraction bars, e.g.  $\frac{5 - 12}{3 - 8}$
[1285|p39] - root signs, such as square roots and cube roots, e.g.  $\sqrt{9 + 16}$

[1831|p52|T1] 2.1 Using letters to represent unknown values

[1835|p52] Area of a rectangle  $=$  length  $\times$  width, so  $A = h$
[1836|p52] Area of a triangle  $= \frac{1}{2} \times$  base  $\times$  height, so  $A = \frac{1}{2} bh$  or  $A = \frac{bh}{2}$
[1837|p52] When two letters are multiplied together, you write them next to each other, e.g. for  $l \times w$  you would write  $l \times w$ .
[1838|p52] To use a formula you have to replace some or all of the letters with numbers. This is called substitution.
[1839|p52|T1] Writing algebraic expressions
[1840|p52] An algebraic expression is a group of letters and numbers linked by operation signs. Each part of the expression is called a term.

[1842|p52] $h + 10$  and  $h - 3$  are algebraic expressions. Because the unknown value is represented by  $h$ , we say these are expressions in terms of  $h$ .

[1847|p53|T1] WORKED EXAMPLE 1
[1848|p53] Use algebra to write an expression in terms of  $h$  (which represents average height) for:
[1849|p53] a a height 12 cm shorter than average
[1850|p53] b a height 2a taller than average
[1851|p53] a height twice the average height
[1852|p53] d a height half the average height.
[1853|p53|T1] Answers
[1854|p53] a  $h - 12$  Shorter than means less than, so you subtract.
[1855|p53] b  $h + 2a$  Taller than means more than, so you add. 2a is unknown, but it can still be used in the expression.
[1856|p53] $2\times h = 2h$  Twice means two times, so you multiply by two.
[1857|p53] d  $h\div 2 = \frac{h}{2}$  Half means divided by two.
[1858|p53|T1] Applying the rules
[1859|p53] You should write algebraic expressions in the shortest, simplest possible way:
[1860|p53] $2\times h$  is written as  $2h$  and  $x\times y$  is written as  $xy$
[1861|p53] $h$  means  $1\times h$  , but you do not write the 1
[1862|p53] $h\div 2$  is written as  $\frac{h}{2}$  and  $x\div y$  is written as  $\frac{x}{y}$
[1863|p53] - when you have the product of a number and a variable, the number is written first, so  $2h$  and not  $h2$ . Also, variables are normally written in...
[1864|p53] $h\times h$  is written as  $h^2$  (h squared) and  $h\times h\times h$  is written as  $h^3$  (h cubed). The  $\mathbf{2}$  and the  $\mathbf{3}$  ar...
[1865|p53] the power only applies to the number or variable directly before it, so  $5a^2$  means  $5 \times a \times a$
[1866|p53] - when a power is outside a bracket, it applies to everything inside the bracket, so  $(xy)^3$  means  $xy \times xy \times xy$ .

[2587|p69|T1] Revisiting index notation
[2588|p69] When you write a number using indices (powers) you have written it in index notation. Any number can be used as an index including 0, negative integer...
[2589|p69] The index tells you how many times the base has been multiplied by itself. So:
[2590|p69] [Table Row] <tr><td>\( 3 \times  3 \times  3 \times  3 = {3}^{4} \)</td><td>3 is the base, 4 is the index</td></tr>
[2591|p69] [Table Row] <tr><td>\( a \times  a \times  a \times  a \times  a = {a}^{5} \)</td><td>\( a \) is the base, 5 is the index</td></tr>

[2606|p70|T1] Multiplying the same base with different indices
[2607|p70] Look at these two multiplications:
[2608|p70] $$
3 ^ {2} \times 3 ^ {4} \quad x ^ {3} \times x ^ {4}
$$
[2609|p70] In the first multiplication, 3 is the base and in the second,  $x$  is the base.
[2610|p70] You already know you can simplify these by expanding them like this:
[2611|p70] $$
3 \times 3 \times 3 \times 3 \times 3 \times 3 = 3 ^ {6} \quad x \times x \times x \times x \times x \times x \times x = x ^ {7}
$$
[2612|p70] In other words:

3 ^ {2} \times 3 ^ {4} = 3 ^ {2 + 4} \quad \text {a n d} \quad x ^ {3} \times x ^ {4} = x ^ {3 + 4}
$$
[2614|p70] When you multiply index expressions with the same base you can add the indices:

[2630|p71] Look at these two divisions:

3 ^ {4} \div 3 ^ {2} \quad \text {a n d} \quad x ^ {6} \div x ^ {2}

[2632|p71] You already know you can simplify these by writing them in expanded form and cancelling like this:
[2633|p71] $$

$$
[2636|p71] When you divide index expressions with the same base you can subtract the indices:

[2659|p71] Any value divided by itself gives 1, so  $3 \div 3 = 1$  and  $x \div x = 1$  and  $\frac{x^4}{x^4} = 1$ .
[2660|p71] If you use the law of indices for division you can see that  $\frac{x^4}{x^4} = x^{4 - 4} = x^0$
[2661|p71] So, you can see that  $\frac{x^4}{x^4} = x^0 = 1$
[2662|p71] Any value to the power 0 is equal to 1. So  $x^0 = 1$ .

[2856|p76] What number multiplied by itself and then by itself again will give  $y$ ?
[2857|p76] $$
\sqrt [ 3 ]{y} \times \sqrt [ 3 ]{y} \times \sqrt [ 3 ]{y} = y
$$
[2858|p76] $$
\mathrm {S o} y ^ {\frac {1}{4}} = \sqrt [ 3 ]{y}

[2859|p76] This shows that any root of a number can be written using rational indices.

[2966|p78|T1] SUMMARY
[2967|p78|T1] Do you know ...?
[2968|p78] Algebra has special conventions (rules) that allow you to write mathematical information in short ways.
[2969|p78] Letters in algebra are called variables, the number before a letter is called a coefficient and numbers on their own are called constants.
[2970|p78] A group of numbers and variables is called a term. Terms are separated by  $+$  and  $-$  signs, but not by  $\times$  or  $\div$  signs.
[2971|p78] Like terms have exactly the same combination of variables and powers. You can add and subtract like terms. You can multiply and divide like and unlike...
[2972|p78] The order of operations rules for numbers (BODMAS) apply in algebra as well.
[2973|p78] Removing brackets (multiplying out) is called expanding the expression. Collecting like terms is called simplifying the expression.
[2974|p78] Powers are also called indices. The index tells you how many times a number or variable is multiplied by itself. Indices only apply to the number or v...
[2975|p78] The laws of indices are a set of rules for simplifying expressions with indices. These laws apply to positive, negative, zero and fractional indices.
[2976|p79|T1] SUMMARY CONTINUED
[2977|p79] Are you able to ...?
[2978|p79] use letters to represent numbers
[2979|p79] write expressions to represent mathematical information
[2980|p79] To substitute letters with numbers to find the value of an expression.
[2981|p79] add and subtract like terms to simplify expressions
[2982|p79] multiply and divide to simplify expressions
[2983|p79] expand expressions by removing brackets and getting rid of other grouping symbols
[2984|p79] use and make sense of positive, negative and zero indices
[2985|p79] We apply the laws of indices to simplify expressions.
[2986|p79] work with fractional indices
[2987|p79] solve exponential equations using fractional indices.

[3190|p88] Here are two different methods for measuring a reflex angle with a  $180^{\circ}$  protractor. Use the method that you find easier.

[3198|p89] Extend  $AB$  to point  $D$ . You know the angle of a straight line is  $180^{\circ}$ . So  $ABD = 180^{\circ}$ .
[3200|p89] Measure the other piece of the angle  $DBC$  (marked  $x$ ) and add this to  $180^\circ$  to find angle  $ABC$ .
[3201|p89] $$
\begin{array}{l} 1 8 0 ^ {\circ} + 1 3 0 ^ {\circ} = 3 1 0 ^ {\circ} \\ \therefore A B C = 3 1 0 ^ {\circ} \\ \end{array}
$$
[3202|p89] Method 2: Measure the inner (non-reflex) angle and subtract it from  $360^{\circ}$  to get the size of the reflex angle.
[3204|p89] You can see that the angle  $ABC$  is almost  $360^{\circ}$ .
[3206|p89] Measure the size of the angle that is  $< 180^{\circ}$  (non-reflex) and subtract from  $360^{\circ}$ .

[3273|p91] 2 What hints can you give people to help them draw angles as accurately as possible?
[3274|p91|T1] Angle relationships
[3275|p91] Make sure you know the following angle facts:
[3276|p91] Complementary angles
[3277|p91] Angles in a right angle add up to  $90^{\circ}$ .
[3278|p92] When the sum of two angles is  $90^{\circ}$  those two angles are complementary angles.
[3281|p92|T1] Supplementary angles
[3282|p92] Angles on a straight line add up to  $180^{\circ}$ .
[3283|p92] When the sum of two angles is  $180^{\circ}$  those two angles are supplementary angles.
[3286|p92|T1] Angles round a point
[3287|p92] Angles at a point make a complete revolution.
[3288|p92] The sum of the angles at a point is  $360^{\circ}$
[3292|p92|T1] Vertically opposite angles
[3293|p92] When two lines intersect, two pairs of vertically opposite angles are formed.
[3294|p92] Vertically opposite angles are equal in size.
[3298|p92|T1] TIP
[3299|p92] In general terms:
[3300|p92] For complementary angles, if one angle is  $x^{\circ}$ , the other must be  $90 - x^{\circ}$  and vice versa.
[3301|p92] For supplementary angles, if one angle is  $x^{\circ}$ , the other must be  $180 - x^{\circ}$  and vice versa.
[3302|p92|T1] TIP
[3303|p92] The adjacent angle pairs in vertically opposite angles form pairs of supplementary angles because they are also angles on a straight line.
[3304|p93|T1] Using angle relationships to find unknown angles
[3305|p93] You can use the relationships between angles to work out the size of unknown angles.
[3306|p93] To do this:
[3307|p93] identify the relationship
[3308|p93] make an equation
[3309|p93] - give reasons for statements
[3310|p93] - solve the equation to find the unknown value.

[3397|p96] $a = 47^{\circ}$  (CAB alt SBA)

[4885|p163] Which two of  $\frac{5}{6}, \frac{20}{25}$  and  $\frac{15}{18}$  are equivalent fractions?
[4886|p163|T1] Answer
[4887|p163] 5 is already in its simplest form.
[4888|p163|T1] Alternative method
[4889|p163] Simplify each of the other fractions:
[4890|p163] You could have written:
[4891|p163] $$
\frac {2 0}{2 5} = \frac {2 0 + 5}{2 5 + 5} = \frac {4}{5}
$$
[4892|p163] $$
\frac {5 1 8}{1 8} = \frac {5}{6}
$$
[4893|p163] $$
\frac {1 5}{1 8} = \frac {1 5 \div 3}{1 8 \div 3} = \frac {5}{6}
$$
[4894|p163] This is called cancelling and is a shorter way of showing what you have done.
[4895|p163] So  $\frac{5}{6}$  and  $\frac{15}{18}$  are equivalent.

[4935|p164] Another method is to cancel before multiplying:
[4936|p164] $$
\frac {3}{2 4} \times \frac {2}{7} = \frac {3 \times 1}{2 \times 7} = \frac {3}{1 4}

[5039|p167|T1] Dividing fractions
[5040|p167] To divide one fraction by another, you multiply the first fraction by the reciprocal of the second fraction.
[5041|p167] To find the reciprocal of a fraction you invert it. So, the reciprocal of  $\frac{3}{4}$  is  $\frac{4}{3}$  and the reciprocal of  $\frac{7}{2}$  is ...
[5042|p167] The reciprocal of  $\frac{1}{2}$  is  $\frac{2}{1}$  or just 2 and the reciprocal of 5 is  $\frac{1}{5}$ .
[5043|p167] When you multiply a fraction by its reciprocal the result is always 1. For example:
[5044|p167] $$
\frac {1}{3} \times \frac {3}{1} = 1, \quad \frac {3}{8} \times \frac {8}{3} = 1 \quad \text {a n d} \quad \frac {a}{b} \times \frac {b}{a} = 1.
$$
[5045|p167] Look at the example below to understand why this method works.
[5046|p167] $$
\frac {5}{1 1} \div \frac {1}{2} = \frac {\frac {5}{1 1}}{\frac {1}{2}}

[5250|p174] a Express 16 as a percentage of 48.
[5251|p174|T1] Answer
[5252|p174] $$
\frac{16}{48}\times 100 = 33.3\% (1d.p.)
$$
[5253|p174] First, write 16 as a fraction of 48, then multiply by 100.
[5254|p174] $$
\frac {1 6}{4 8} = \frac {1}{3}
$$
[5255|p174] If you are working without a calculator, you may find it easier to write the fraction in its simplest form first.
[5256|p174] $$
\frac{1}{3}\times 100 = 33.3\% (1d.p.)
$$
[5257|p174] b Express 15 as a percentage of 75.
[5258|p174|T1] Answer
[5259|p174] $$
\begin{array}{l} \frac {1 5}{7 5} \times 1 0 0 = \frac {1}{5} \times 1 0 0 \\ = 20\% \\ \end{array}
$$
[5260|p174] Write 15 as a fraction of 75, then simplify and multiply by 100. You know that 100 divided by 5 is 20, so you don't need a calculator.
[5261|p174] c Express 18 as a percentage of 23.

[5294|p175] The value of a house increased from  $120000 to$ 124800 between August and December. What percentage increase is this?
[5295|p175|T1] Answer
[5296|p175] $$
\$ 124800 - \$ 120000 = \$ 4800
$$
[5297|p175] First calculate the increase.
[5298|p175] $$
\% \text {increase} = \frac {\text {increase}}{\text {original}} \times 100 \%
$$
[5299|p175] Write the increase as a fraction of the original and multiply by 100.
[5300|p175] $$
= \frac{4800}{120000}\times 100\%
$$
[5301|p175] Then do the calculation (either in your head or using a calculator).

[5337|p177|T1] Answer
[5338|p177] $$
100\% -15\% = 85\%
$$
[5339|p177] Reducing a number by  $15\%$  leaves you with  $85\%$  of the original. So, find  $85\%$  of the original value.
[5340|p177] $$
\frac {8 5}{1 0 0} \times \$ 1 2 0 = \$ 1 0 2
$$
[5341|p177] 85% is equivalent to  $\frac{85}{100} = 0.85$
[5342|p177] Or use a multiplier:
[5343|p177] $$
0. 8 5 \times \$ 1 2 0 = 1 0 2

[5347|p177|T1] Answer
[5349|p177] Draw a bar model.
[5350|p177] A  $25\%$  discount means the software is now  $75\%$  of the original cost.

[5352|p177] $$
1 \% = \frac {\mathbb {S} 7 0}{1 0 0} = \mathbb {S} 0. 7

[5353|p177] Divide $70 by 100 to find 1%

[5819|p194] a Solve the equation  $5x - 2 = 3x + 6$
[5820|p194|T1] Answer
[5821|p194] $$
5 x - 2 = 3 x + 6
$$
[5822|p194] $$
5 x - 2 - 3 x = 3 x + 6 - 3 x
$$
[5823|p194] $$
2 x - 2 = 6
$$
[5824|p194] $$
2 x - 2 + 2 = 6 + 2
$$
[5825|p194] $$
2 x = 8
$$
[5826|p194] $$
\frac {2 x}{2} = \frac {8}{2}
$$
[5827|p194] $$
x = 4
$$
[5828|p194] Subtract  $3x$  from both sides.
[5829|p194] Add 2 to both sides.
[5830|p194] Divide both sides by 2.
[5831|p194] An equation with  $x$  on both sides and  $x$  terms with different signs:
[5832|p194] b Solve the equation  $5x + 12 = 20 - 11x$
[5833|p194|T1] Answer
[5834|p194] $$
5 x + 1 2 = 2 0 - 1 1 x
$$
[5835|p194] $$
5 x + 1 2 + 1 1 x = 2 0 - 1 1 x + 1 1 x
$$
[5836|p194] $$
1 6 x + 1 2 = 2 0
$$
[5837|p194] $$
1 6 x + 1 2 - 1 2 = 2 0 - 1 2
$$
[5838|p194] $$
1 6 x = 8
$$
[5839|p194] $$
\frac {1 6 x}{1 6} = \frac {8}{1 6}
$$
[5840|p194] $$
x = \frac {1}{2}
$$
[5841|p194] This time add  $11x$  to both sides, so you have a positive number of  $x$ 's
[5842|p194] Subtract 12 from both sides.
[5843|p194] Divide both sides by 16.
[5844|p194] An equation with brackets on at least one side:

[5846|p194|T1] Answer
[5847|p194] $$
2 y - 8 + 4 y + 8 = 3 0
$$
[5848|p194] $$
6 y = 3 0
$$
[5849|p194] $$
\frac {6 y}{6} = \frac {3 0}{6}
$$
[5850|p194] $$
y = 5
$$
[5851|p194] Expand the brackets.
[5852|p194] Collect like terms.
[5853|p194] Divide both sides by 6.
[5854|p194] An equation that contains fractions:
[5855|p194] d Solve the equation  $\frac{6}{7} p = 10$
[5856|p194|T1] Answer
[5857|p194] $$
\frac {6}{7} p \times 7 = 1 0 \times 7
$$
[5858|p194] $$
6 p = 7 0
$$
[5859|p194] $$
\frac {6 p}{6} = \frac {7 0}{6}
$$
[5860|p194] $$
p = \frac {3 5}{3}
$$
[5861|p194] Multiply both sides by 7.
[5862|p194] Divide both sides by 6.
[5863|p194] Write the fraction in its simplest form.
[5864|p194|T1] TIP
[5865|p194] You could subtract  $5x$  from both sides instead, but this gives a negative coefficient of  $x$  which is clumsy to work with.
[5866|p194|T1] TIP

[6100|p200] Sometimes it is more helpful to have a different variable as the subject so you need to know how to change the subject of a formula. In the formula  $...
[6101|p200] For example, to make  $a$  the subject of this formula:
[6102|p200] $\nu = u + at$  Write down the starting formula.
[6103|p200] $v - u = at$  Subtract  $u$  from both sides (to isolate the term containing  $a$
[6104|p200] $\frac{v - u}{t} = a$  Divide both sides by  $t$  (notice that everything on the left is divided by  $t$ ).
[6105|p200] You now have  $a$  on its own and so now  $a$  is the subject of the formula.
[6106|p200] Usually we rewrite this so the subject is on the left:
[6107|p200] $$
a = \frac {v - u}{t}

[6115|p200] a  $x + y = c$
[6116|p200] $$
\Rightarrow y = c - x

[6117|p200] Subtract  $x$  from both sides.
[6118|p200] b  $\frac{a - b}{c} = d$
[6119|p200] $\Rightarrow a - b = cd$  Multiply both sides by c to clear the fraction.
[6120|p200] $\Rightarrow a = cd + b$  Make the number of  $b$  's positive by adding  $b$  to both sides.
[6121|p200] So  $b = a - cd$  Subtract cd from both sides.
[6122|p200] Rewrite so the subject is on the left.
[6123|p200] c x+y=2
[6124|p200] $\Rightarrow \sqrt{x} = z - y$  Subtractyfromboth sides

[6260|p208|T1] WORKED EXAMPLE 1
[6261|p208] a Calculate the area of the shape shown in the diagram.
[6263|p208|T1] Answer
[6264|p208] Divide the shape into two simple polygons: a rectangle and a triangle. Work out the area of each shape and then add them together.
[6267|p208] Area of rectangle  $= bh = 7\times 5 = 35cm^2$  (substitute values in place of  $b$  and  $h$
[6268|p208] Area of triangle  $= \frac{1}{2} bh = \frac{1}{2} \times 5 \times 6 = \frac{1}{2} \times 30 = 15\mathrm{cm}^2$
[6269|p208] Total area  $= 35 + 15 = 50\mathrm{cm}^2$
[6270|p208] b The area of a triangle is  $40\mathrm{cm}^2$  . If the base of the triangle is  $5\mathrm{cm}$  , find the height.
[6271|p208|T1] Answer
[6272|p208] $$
A = \frac {1}{2} \times b \times h
$$
[6273|p208] Use the formula for the area of a triangle.
[6274|p208] $$
4 0 = \frac {1}{2} \times 5 \times h
$$
[6275|p208] Substitute all values that you know.
[6276|p208] $$
\Rightarrow 4 0 \times 2 = 5 \times h
$$
[6277|p208] $\Rightarrow  h = \frac{{40} \times  2}{5} = \frac{80}{5} = {16}\mathrm{\;{cm}}$
[6278|p208] Rearrange the formula to make  $h$  the subject.
[6279|p208] c A square has area  $36\mathrm{cm}^2$  . Find the perimeter of the square.
[6280|p208|T1] Answer
[6281|p208] If  $x$  is the length of each side of the square, then:
[6282|p208] $$
\begin{array}{l} x ^ {2} = 3 6 \\ x = \sqrt {3 6} = 6 \mathrm {c m} \\ \end{array}
$$
[6283|p208] There are four equal sides, so the perimeter is  $4 \times 6 = 24\mathrm{cm}$ .
[6284|p208|T1] TIP
[6285|p208] You do not usually have to redraw the separate shapes, but you might find it helpful.

[6371|p213] You can find the circumference of a circle using formulae that uses either the radius or the diameter:
[6372|p213] Circumference  $= \pi \times$  diameter
[6373|p213] $= \pi d$  (where  $d =$  diameter)
[6374|p213] $= 2\pi r$  (where  $r =$  radius)
[6375|p213|T1] Finding the area of a circle
[6376|p213] There is a simple formula for calculating the area of a circle. Here is a method that shows how you can work out the formula:
[6377|p213] Consider the circle shown in the diagram. It has been divided into 12 equal parts and these have been rearranged to give the diagram on the right.
[6379|p213] The parts of the circle are narrow, so the shape almost forms a rectangle with height equal to the radius of the circle and the length equal to half o...
[6380|p214] The formula for the area of a rectangle is area  $= bh$ , so:
[6381|p214] Area of a circle is approximately equal to
[6382|p214] $\frac{1}{2} \times 2\pi r \times r$  (Using the base and height shown in the diagram on the previous page.)
[6383|p214] $$
= \pi r ^ {2} \quad \text {(S i m p l i f y .)}
$$
[6384|p214] If you try this yourself by dividing a circle into a greater number of parts that are even narrower, you will notice that the right-hand diagram will ...
[6385|p214] This indicates (but does not prove) that the area of a circle is given by:  $A = \pi r^2$ .

[6609|p225] It can be helpful to draw the net of a solid when trying to find its surface area.
[6610|p225|T1] Cuboids
[6611|p225] A cuboid has six rectangular faces, twelve edges and eight vertices.
[6612|p225] If the length, width and height of the cuboid are  $a, b$  and  $c$  (respectively) then you can find the surface area by thinking about the areas of ...
[6614|p226] Notice that the surface area is exactly the same as the area of the cuboid's net.
[6615|p226] Surface area of cuboid  $= 2(ab + ac + bc)$
[6617|p226] The volume of a cuboid is its length  $\times$  width  $\times$  height.
[6618|p226] Volume of cuboid  $= a b c$
[6620|p226|T1] Prisms
[6621|p226] A prism is a solid whose cross-section is the same all along its length. (A cross-section is the surface formed when you cut parallel to a face.)
[6623|p226] Prisms are often named according to the shape of their cross-section. For example, a triangular prism has a triangle cross-section, a pentagonal prism...
[6624|p227] A cuboid is a prism with a rectangular cross-section, so you may sometimes see it called a rectangular prism.
[6627|p227] You can calculate the surface area of a prism by working out the area of each face and adding them together. There are two ends with area equal to the...
[6628|p227] Surface area of a prism  $= 2 \times$  area of cross-section + perimeter of cross-section  $\times$  length
[6629|p227] You can calculate the volume of a prism by working out the area of the cross-section and multiplying this by the length.

[6671|p230|T1] Pyramids
[6672|p230] A pyramid is a solid with a polygon-shaped base and triangular faces that meet at a point called the apex.
[6673|p230] You can find the surface area of a pyramid by finding the area of the base and the area of each of the triangles and adding them all together.
[6674|p230] You can find the volume of a pyramid by using the following formula:
[6675|p230] Volume  $= \frac{1}{3} \times$  base area  $\times$  perpendicular height
[6676|p230] The perpendicular height is the shortest distance from the base to the apex.
[6677|p230|T1] Cones

[6681|p230] The curved surface of the cone can be opened out and flattened to form a sector of a circle.
[6682|p230] Curved surface area of cone  $= \pi r l$
[6683|p230] If you are asked for the total surface area of a cone, you must work out the area of the circular base and add it to the curved surface area.

[6758|p235|T1] SUMMARY
[6759|p235|T1] Do you know ...?
[6760|p235] The perimeter is the distance around the outside of a two-dimensional shape and the area is the space contained within the sides.
[6761|p235] Circumference is the name for the perimeter of a circle.
[6762|p235] If the units of length are given in cm then the units of area are cm² and the units of volume are cm³.
[6763|p235] This relationship is also true if the lengths are measured in mm, m, km and so on.
[6764|p235] A sector of a circle is the region contained in-between two radii of a circle. This splits the circle into a minor sector and a major sector.
[6765|p235] An arc is a section of the circumference.
[6766|p235] Prisms, pyramids, spheres, cubes and cuboids are examples of three-dimensional objects (or solids).
[6767|p235] A net is a two-dimensional shape that can be folded to form a solid.
[6768|p235] The net of a solid can be useful when working out the surface area of the solid.
[6769|p235|T1] Are you able to ...?

[8596|p249] All possible outcomes are correctly indicated.
[8597|p249] The diagram is easy to read and interpret.
[8598|p249] You can find the probability of different events easily.

[8602|p250] Did you draw a clear diagram?
[8603|p250] How do you think someone asking questions could help you to overcome difficulties and understand the work better?
[8604|p250|T1] 8.3 Combining independent and mutually exclusive events
[8605|p250] Sometimes you will need to calculate the probability that two events happen, one after the other. You might also need to calculate the probability tha...
[8606|p250|T1] Independent events

[8609|p250|T1] MATHEMATICAL CONNECTIONS
[8610|p250] If you do not replace the first ball the events will not be independent. There is one ball less for the second choice so the probabilities will have c...
[8611|p250] You can calculate the probability that two independent events,  $A$  and  $B$ , both occur:
[8612|p250] $P(A$  happens and then  $B$  happens)  $= P(A)\times P(B)$
[8613|p250] or
[8614|p250] $P(A$  and  $B) = P(A)\times P(B)$
[8615|p250] For example, when flipping two coins,
[8616|p250] P(flipping two heads) = P(Heads) × P(Heads) = 1/2 × 1/2 = 1/4
[8617|p250|T1] TIP
[8618|p250] Note that this formula is only true if  $A$  and  $B$  are independent.
[8619|p251|T1] Mutually exclusive events
[8620|p251] If you throw a normal dice and let:
[8621|p251] $$
A = \text {t h e e v e n t t h a t y o u g e a n e v e n n u m b e r}
$$
[8622|p251] and
[8623|p251] $$
B = \text {t h e e v e n t t h a t y o u g e a n o d d n u m b e r}
$$
[8624|p251] then  $A$  and  $B$  cannot happen together because no number is both even and odd at the same time. You can say that  $A$  and  $B$  are mutually exc...
[8625|p251|T1] MATHEMATICAL CONNECTIONS

[8627|p251] For two mutually exclusive events  $A$  and  $B$ , you can calculate the probability that either  $A$  or  $B$  occurs:
[8628|p251] $$
P (A \text {o r} B) = P (A) + P (B)
$$
[8629|p251] For example, when rolling a normal dice,

[8631|p251] Worked examples 8 and 9 demonstrate how you can use these simple formulae for independent and mutually exclusive events.
[8632|p251|T1] TIP
[8633|p251] Note, this formula only works if A and B are mutually exclusive.
[8634|p251|T1] WORKED EXAMPLE 8
[8635|p251] Noa and Sunja are both taking a music examination independently.
[8636|p251] The probability that Noa passes is  $\frac{3}{4}$  and the probability that Sunja passes is  $\frac{5}{6}$ .
[8637|p251] What is the probability that:
[8638|p251] a both pass?
[8639|p251] b neither passes?
[8640|p251] at least one passes?
[8641|p251] either Noa or Sunja passes (but not both)?
[8642|p251|T1] Answers
[8643|p251] a  $P(\text{both pass}) = P(\text{Noa passes and Sunja passes})$
[8644|p251] The outcomes are independent so use the formula:
[8645|p251] $$
= \frac {3}{4} \times \frac {5}{6} = \frac {1 5}{2 4} = \frac {5}{8}
$$
[8646|p251] $$
P (A \text {a n d} B) = P (A) \times P (B)
$$

[8715|p254|T1] SUMMARY
[8716|p254|T1] Do you know ...?
[8717|p254] Probability measures how likely something is to happen.
[8718|p254] An outcome is the single result of an experiment.
[8719|p254] An event is a collection of favourable outcomes.
[8720|p254] Experimental probability can be calculated by dividing the number of favourable outcomes by the number of trials.
[8721|p254] Favourable outcomes are any outcomes that mean your event has happened.
[8722|p254] If outcomes are equally likely then theoretical probability can be calculated by dividing the number of favourable outcomes by the number of possible ...
[8723|p254] The probability of an event happening and the probability of that event not happening will always sum up to one. If  $A$  is an event, then  $A'$  is ...
[8724|p254] Independent events do not affect one another.
[8725|p254] Mutually exclusive events cannot happen together.
[8726|p254|T1] Are you able to ...?
[8727|p254] find an experimental probability given the results of several trials
[8728|p254] find a theoretical probability
[8729|p254] find the probability that an event will not happen if you know the probability that it will happen.

[8986|p266|T1] 9.1 Sequences

[8988|p266] The position of a term is given using  $\mathbf{T}$  so  $\mathbf{T}_1$  is the first term,  $\mathbf{T}_5$  is the fifth term and  $\mathbf{T}_n$  is...

[8990|p266] There are different kinds of sequences.
[8991|p266] Arithmetic sequences have a common (constant) difference between the terms. For example, the sequence 2, 6, 10, 14, ... has a common difference of +4 ...
[8992|p266] Non-linear sequences do not have a common difference between the terms.
[8993|p266] Geometric sequences involve multiplying or dividing by a common ratio. For example, each term in the sequence 3, 6, 12, 24, ... is found by multiplyin...
[8994|p266] Some sequences involve powers:
[8995|p266] quadratic sequences involve square numbers. For example, 1, 4, 9, 16, ...
[8996|p266] cubic sequences involve cube numbers. For example, 1, 8, 27, 64, ...
[8997|p266|T1] The term-to-term rule
[8998|p266] Here are some sequences with the rule that tells you how to keep the sequence going:
[8999|p266] 2, 8, 14, 20, 26, 32, ... (get the next term by adding six to the previous term).
[9000|p266] You can show this pattern by drawing it in this way:
[9002|p266] 1,  $\frac{1}{2}, \frac{1}{4}, \frac{1}{8}, \frac{1}{16}, \ldots$  (divide each term by two to get the next term).
[9003|p266] This diagram shows how the sequence progresses:
[9005|p266] 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, ... (multiply each term by two to get the next term).

[9028|p267] 3 The first term  $(T_{1})$  of a sequence is 5. The term-to-term rule for the sequence is 'add  $x$ '.
[9029|p267] Find the value of  $x$  that will give you each of these sequences:
[9030|p267] a every second term is not an integer
[9031|p267] b every second term is a multiple of 10.
[9032|p267] c  $\mathrm{T}_2 <   \mathrm{T}_1$
[9033|p267|T1] Relating a term to its position in the sequence
[9034|p267] The term-to-term rule is useful for finding the next few terms in a sequence. However, if you are asked to find the 20th term or the 100th term it is ...
[9035|p267] To find the rule you have to work systematically with the term number and the value of each term. Tables are very useful for doing this.
[9036|p267] This table shows the term number and the value of the first five terms in a sequence.
[9037|p267] [Table Row] <tr><td>Term number (n)</td><td>1</td><td>2</td><td>3</td><td>4</td><td>5</td></tr>
[9038|p267] [Table Row] <tr><td>Term</td><td>5</td><td>8</td><td>11</td><td>14</td><td>17</td></tr>
[9039|p267] You can see that the difference between the terms is 3. This tells you something about the algebraic rule.
[9040|p267] If you multiply each term number  $(n)$  by 3, you get:
[9041|p267] [Table Row] <tr><td>Term number (n)</td><td>1</td><td>2</td><td>3</td><td>4</td><td>5</td></tr>
[9042|p267] [Table Row] <tr><td>Term</td><td>5</td><td>8</td><td>11</td><td>14</td><td>17</td></tr>
[9043|p267] [Table Row] <tr><td>3 × n</td><td>3</td><td>6</td><td>9</td><td>12</td><td>15</td></tr>
[9044|p268] By comparing the value of each term with the value of  $3n$ , you can see that the term is 2 more than  $3n$  each time.
[9045|p268] This means that each term is  $3 \times n + 2$  or  $3n + 2$ .
[9046|p268] This is called a position-to-term rule.
[9047|p268] An expression for the term in position  $n$  is called the  $n$ th term (or general term). So for this sequence the  $n$ th term  $= 3n + 2$ .
[9048|p268] Notice that the common difference between each term in the sequence is the value that is multiplying  $n$  (the coefficient of  $n$ ) in the  $n$ th t...
[9049|p268] You can use this rule to find the term in any position by substituting the value of  $n$  into the rule. For example:
[9050|p268] the 45th term  $= 3(45) + 2 = 137$
[9051|p268] the 90th term  $= 3(90) + 2 = 272$

[9065|p268] Each term is 2 less than  $4n$ , so the rule for the nth term is  $4n - 2$ .
[9066|p268] b 40th term  $\therefore n = 40$
[9067|p268] To find the 40th term in the sequence substitute
[9068|p268] $$
4 \times 4 0 - 2 = 1 5 8
$$
[9069|p268] $n = 40$  into the nth term formula.
[9070|p268] c  $4n - 2 = 50$
[9071|p268] If the number 50 is in the sequence there must be a value of  $n$  for which  $4n - 2 = 50$ . Rearrange the rule to make  $n$  the subject.
[9072|p268] $$
4 n - 2 = 5 0
$$
[9073|p268] $$
4 n = 5 2
$$
[9074|p268] $$
n = \frac {5 2}{4} = 1 3
$$
[9075|p268] Add 2 to both sides.
[9076|p268] Divide both sides by 4.
[9077|p269|T1] WORKED EXAMPLE 1 CONTINUED
[9078|p269] Since this has given a whole number, 50 must be the  $13^{\text{th}}$  term in the sequence.
[9079|p269] d  $4n - 2 = 125$
[9080|p269] If the number 125 is in the sequence then there must be a value of  $n$  for which  $4n - 2 = 125$ . Rearrange to make  $n$  the subject.
[9081|p269] $$
4 n = 1 2 7
$$
[9082|p269] Add 2 to both sides.
[9083|p269] $$
n = \frac {1 2 7}{4} = 3 1. 7 5
$$
[9084|p269] Divide both sides by 4.
[9085|p269] Since  $n$  is the position in the sequence it must be a whole number and it is not in this case. This means that 125 cannot be a number in the sequen...

[9091|p269|T1] Answer
[9092|p269] Work out the difference between terms in the sequence. This is known as the first difference.
[9094|p269] The first difference is not constant so work out the second difference:
[9096|p269] The second difference is constant. This means the sequence is quadratic and the rule will involve  $n^2$ .

[9099|p270|T1] WORKED EXAMPLE 2 CONTINUED
[9100|p270] Make a table to show the position of each term and include a row for the values of  $n^2$ .
[9101|p270] [Table Row] <tr><td>n</td><td>1</td><td>2</td><td>3</td><td>4</td><td>5</td></tr>
[9102|p270] [Table Row] <tr><td>Term</td><td>2</td><td>5</td><td>10</td><td>17</td><td>26</td></tr>
[9103|p270] [Table Row] <tr><td>n2</td><td>1</td><td>4</td><td>9</td><td>16</td><td>25</td></tr>
[9104|p270] Each term is 1 greater than the value of  $n^2$ , so the  $n$ th term is  $n^2 + 1$ .
[9105|p270] All quadratic sequences have a constant second difference.
[9106|p270] If the sequence is cubic it will have a constant third difference and the rule for the sequence will involve  $n^3$ .
[9107|p270] The general term of a quadratic sequence is in the form  $an^2 + bn + c$ .
[9108|p270] This table shows the first four terms in the general sequence and their first and second differences.
[9109|p270] [Table Row] <tr><td>n</td><td>1</td><td>2</td><td>3</td><td>4</td></tr>
[9110|p270] [Table Row] <tr><td>Term</td><td>a + b + c</td><td>4a + 2b + c</td><td>9a + 3b + c</td><td>16a + 4b + c</td></tr>

[9112|p270] [Table Row] <tr><td>2nd difference</td><td>2a</td><td>2a</td><td></td><td></td></tr>
[9113|p270] The table shows that for any quadratic sequence:
[9114|p270] the 1st term is  $a + b + c$
[9115|p270] the 2nd term minus the 1st term  $(\mathrm{T}_2 - \mathrm{T}_1)$  is  $3a + b$
[9116|p270] the 2nd difference is  $2a$
[9117|p270] This gives us a way to work out the general term for complex quadratic sequences.

[9122|p270] Once you have values for each expression you can make equations to find  $a$ ,  $b$ , and  $c$ .
[9123|p270] $$
2 a = 2, \text {s o} a = 1
$$
[9124|p270] Find the value of a first.
[9125|p270] $$
3 a + b = 6
$$
[9126|p270] Find b by substituting the value of a.
[9127|p270] $$
3 (1) + b = 6, \text {s o} b = 3
$$
[9128|p270|T1] TIP
[9129|p270] If you are not told the sequence is quadratic, you will need to check that the second difference is constant before using this method.

[9140|p271] T 20×5×5×5=20×5
[9141|p271] You can see that for each term the exponent is one less than the term number.

[9263|p277] Use the ideas from the previous section to find the value of the 'something'.
[9264|p277] Taking any term in the sequence from the table, for example the first:
[9265|p277] $n = 1$  , so  $2n = 2\times 1 = 2$  . But the first term is 3, so you need to add 1.
[9266|p277] So, nth term  $= 2n + 1$
[9267|p277] Which means that, if you let  $m$  be the number of matches in pattern  $n$  then,  $m = 2n + 1$ .

[9281|p278] b  $4p$  is in the formula
[9282|p278] Notice that the number of squares increases by 4 from shape to shape.
[9283|p278] This means that there will be a term  $4p^{\prime}$  in the formula.
[9284|p278] $$
\begin{array}{l} \text {I f} p = 1 \text {t h e n} 4 p = 4 \\ 4 + 3 = 7 \\ s o, s = 4 p + 3 \\ \end{array}
$$
[9285|p278] Now, if  $p = 1$  then  $4p = 4$ . The first term is 7, so you need to add 3.
[9286|p278] This means that  $s = 4p + 3$ .
[9287|p278] $$
\text {I f} p = 5 \text {t h e n}
$$
[9288|p278] $$
4 p + 3 = 2 0 + 3 = 2 3,

[9289|p278] the rule is correct.

[9323|p279] 12 = n  $n = -12$  but we cannot have a -12th term so  $n = 12$

[9392|p281|T1] Converting recurring decimals to fractions
[9393|p281] What can we do with a decimal that continues forever but does repeat?
[9394|p281] Is this kind of number rational or irrational?
[9395|p281] As an example we will look at the number 0.4.
[9396|p281] We can use algebra to find another way of writing this recurring decimal:
[9397|p281] Let
[9398|p281] $$
x = 0. \dot {4} = 0. 4 4 4 4 4 4 \dots

[9399|p281] Then
[9400|p281] $$
1 0 x = 4. 4 4 4 4 4 4 \dots

[9401|p281] We can then subtract  $x$  from  $10x$  like this:

\begin{array}{l} 1 0 x = 4. 4 4 4 4 4 4 \dots \\ x = 0. 4 4 4 4 4 4 \dots \\ \end{array}
$$
[9403|p281] $$
\begin{array}{l} 9 x = 4 \\ \Rightarrow x = \frac {4}{9} \\ \end{array}

[9404|p282] This example shows that you can write the recurring decimal 0.4 as a fraction. This means that 0.4 is a rational number.

[9912|p296|T1] 9.4 Sets
[9913|p296] A set is a list or collection of objects that share one or more characteristics. The objects in a set can be anything from numbers, letters and shapes...
[9914|p296] The list of members or elements of a set is placed inside a pair of curly brackets  $\{\}$ .
[9915|p296] Some examples of sets are:
[9916|p296] {2,4,6,8,10} - the set of all even integers greater than zero but less than 11
[9917|p296] $\{\mathbf{a},\mathbf{e},\mathbf{i},\mathbf{o},\mathbf{u}\}$  - the set of vowels
[9918|p296] {Red, Green, Blue} - the set containing the colours red, green and blue.
[9919|p296] We use capital letters to name sets:
[9920|p296] If  $A$  is the set of prime numbers less than 10, then:  $A = \{2, 3, 5, 7\}$ .
[9921|p296] If  $B$  is the set of letters in the word 'HAPPY', then:  $B = \{\mathrm{H},\mathrm{A},\mathrm{P},\mathrm{Y}\}$ .
[9922|p296] Two sets are equal if they contain exactly the same elements, even if the order is different, so:
[9923|p296] $\{1,2,3,4\} = \{4,3,2,1\} = \{2,4,1,3\}$  and so on.
[9924|p296] The number of elements in a set is written as  $\mathfrak{n}(A)$ , where  $A$  is the name of the set. For example, in the set  $A = \{1, 3, 5, 7, 9\}...
[9925|p296] A set that contains no elements is known as the empty set. The symbol  $\varnothing$  is used to represent the empty set.
[9926|p296] For example:
[9927|p296] {odd numbers that are multiples of two} =  $\varnothing$  because no odd number is a multiple of two.
[9928|p296] Now, if  $x$  is a member (an element) of the set  $A$  then it is written:  $x \in A$ .
[9929|p296] If  $x$  is not a member of the set  $A$ , then it is written:  $x \notin A$ .
[9930|p296] For example, if  $H = \{\text{Spades, Clubs, Diamonds, Hearts}\}$ , then:
[9931|p296] Spades  $\in H$  but Turtles  $\notin H$
[9932|p296] Some sets have a number of elements that can be counted. These are known as finite sets. If there is no limit to the number of members of a set then t...
[9933|p296] If  $A = \{\text{letters of the alphabet}\}$ , then  $A$  has 26 members and is finite.
[9934|p296] If  $B = \{\mathrm{positive~integers}\}$ , then  $B = \{1,2,3,4,5,6,\ldots\}$  and is infinite.
[9935|p296] So, to summarise:
[9936|p296] - sets are listed inside curly brackets { }
[9937|p296] -  $\varnothing$  means it is an empty set.
[9938|p296] $a\in B$  means  $a$  is an element of the set  $B$
[9939|p296] -  $a \notin B$  means  $a$  is not an element of the set  $B$ .
[9940|p296] -  $\mathfrak{n}(A)$  is the number of elements in set  $A$ .

[9985|p297|T1] Universal sets
[9986|p297] The following sets all have a number of things in common:
[9987|p297] $$
M = \{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 \}
$$
[9988|p297] $$
N = \{1, 5, 9 \}
$$
[9989|p297] $$
O = \{4, 8, 2 1 \}
$$
[9990|p297] All three are contained within the set of whole numbers. They are also all contained in the set of integers less than 22.
[9991|p297] When you work with sets there is usually a 'largest' set which contains all of the sets that you are studying. This set can change according to the pr...
[9992|p297] Here, the set of integers contains all elements from  $M, N$  or  $O$ . But then so does the set of all positive integers less than 22.
[9993|p298] Both these sets (and many more) can be used as a universal set. A universal set contains all possible elements that you would consider for a set in a ...
[9994|p298|T1] Complements
[9995|p298] The complement of the set  $A$  is the set of all things that are in  $\mathcal{E}$  but NOT in the set  $A$ . The symbol  $A'$  is used to denote the...
[9996|p298] For example, if  $\mathcal{E} = \{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10\}$  and  $F = \{2, 4, 6\}$
[9997|p298] then the complement of  $F$  would be  $F' = \{1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 9, 10\}$ .
[9998|p298] So, in summary:
[9999|p298] $\mathcal{E}$  represents a universal set
[10000|p298] $A^{\prime}$  represents the complement of set  $A$
[10001|p298|T1] Unions and intersections
[10002|p298] The union of two sets,  $A$  and  $B$ , is the set of all elements that are members of  $A$  or members of  $B$  or members of both. The symbol  $\cup...
[10003|p298] $A\cup B$
[10004|p298] The intersection of two sets,  $A$  and  $B$ , is the set of all elements that are members of both  $A$  and  $B$ . The symbol  $\cap$  is used to ind...
[10005|p298] A∩B
[10006|p298] For example, if  $C = \{4, 6, 8, 10\}$  and  $D = \{6, 10, 12, 14\}$ , then:
[10007|p298] $C\cap D =$  the set of all elements common to both  $= \{6,10\}$
[10008|p298] $C\cup D =$  the set of all elements that are in  $C$  or  $D$  or both  $= \{4,6,8,10,12,14\}$
[10009|p298|T1] Subsets
[10010|p298] You already know that a rectangle is a type of quadrilateral and that all rectangles are quadrilaterals. If set  $A$  is the set of all quadrilaterals...
[10011|p298] You can reverse the  $\subseteq$  symbol, but this does not change its meaning.  $B \subseteq A$  means  $B$  is a subset of  $A$ , but so does  $A \s...
[10012|p298] So in summary:
[10013|p298] $\cup$  is the symbol for union
[10014|p298] -  $\cap$  is the symbol for intersection
[10015|p298] -  $B \subseteq A$  indicates that  $B$  is a subset of  $A$ .
[10016|p298] -  $B \notin A$  indicates that  $B$  is not a subset of  $A$ .
[10017|p298|T1] TIP
[10018|p298] Taking the union of two sets is like adding the sets together but remember you do not repeat elements within the set.
[10019|p298|T1] TIP
[10020|p298] The symbol,  $\subseteq$  has a open end and a closed end. The subset goes at the closed end.

[10148|p304|T1] Set builder notation
[10149|p304] So far, the contents of a set have either been given as a list of the elements or described by a rule (in words) that defines whether or not something...
[10150|p304] For example:
[10151|p304] $A = \{x:x$  isanaturalnumber}
[10152|p304] This means:
[10154|p304] In other words, this is the set:  $A = \{1, 2, 3, 4, \ldots\}$ .
[10155|p304] Sometimes the set builder notation contains restrictions.
[10156|p304] For example,  $B = \{x : x \text{ is a letter of the alphabet, } x \text{ is a vowel}\}$ .
[10157|p304] In this case, set  $B = \{\mathbf{a}, \mathbf{e}, \mathbf{i}, \mathbf{o}, \mathbf{u}\}$ .
[10158|p304] Here is another example:
[10159|p304] $A = \{$  integers greater than zero but less than 20\}
[10160|p304] In set builder notation this is:
[10161|p304] $A = \{x:x$  is an integer,  $0 <   x <   20\}$
[10162|p305] This is read as: 'A is the set of all  $x$  such that  $x$  is an integer and  $x$  is greater than zero but less than  $20$ '.
[10163|p305] The following examples show how this notation is used.
[10164|p305|T1] WORKED EXAMPLE 21
[10165|p305] List the members of the set  $C$  if  $C = \{x: x \in \text{primes}, 10 < x < 20\}$ .
[10166|p305|T1] Answer
[10167|p305] Read the set as: 'C is the set of all x'such that x is a member of the set of primes and x is greater than 10 but less than 20'.
[10168|p305] The prime numbers greater than 10 but less than 20 are 11, 13, 17 and 19.
[10169|p305] So,  $C = \{11, 13, 17, 19\}$

[10174|p305] So,  $D = \{x : x \text{ is a triangle,}$  If  $D$  is the set of all right-angled triangles, then  $x$  has a right-angle  $D$  is the set of all  $x...

[10206|p306|T1] Do you know...?
[10207|p306] A sequence is the elements of a set arranged in a particular order, connected by a rule.
[10208|p306] A term is any number in a sequence.
[10209|p306] If the position of a term in a sequence is given the letter  $n$  then a rule can be found to work out the value of the  $n$ th term.
[10210|p306] A rational number is a number that can be written as a fraction.
[10211|p306] An irrational number cannot be written as a fraction and will have a decimal part that continues forever without repeating.
[10212|p306] Sunds are exact values of irrational numbers written with a root sign.
[10213|p306] A surd is in simplest form when it has no factors that are square numbers and when the denominator of a fraction with surds is a rational number.
[10214|p306] A set is a list or collection of objects that share a characteristic.
[10215|p306] An element is a member of a set.
[10216|p306] A set that contains no elements is called the empty set (2).
[10217|p306] A universal set  $(\mathcal{E})$  contains all the possible elements appropriate to a particular problem.
[10218|p306] The complement of a set is the elements that are not in the set  $(^{\prime})$
[10219|p306] The elements of two sets can be combined (without repeats) to form the union of the two sets  $(\cup)$ .
[10220|p306] The elements that two sets have in common is called the intersection of the two sets  $(\cap)$ .
[10221|p306] A Venn diagram is a pictorial method of showing sets.

[10333|p312|T1] GETTING STARTED
[10334|p312] 1 A table of values gives a set of ordered pairs  $(x, y)$  that you can use to plot graphs on a coordinate grid.
[10335|p312] [Table Row] <tr><td>x</td><td>-1</td><td>0</td><td>1</td><td>2</td></tr>
[10336|p312] [Table Row] <tr><td>y</td><td>3</td><td>4</td><td>5</td><td>6</td></tr>
[10337|p312] Plot these points and draw a line through them.
[10338|p312] 2 The standard equation of a straight line graph is  $y = mx + c$ .
[10339|p312] -  $m$  is the gradient (or steepness) of the graph.
[10340|p312] - c is the point where the graph crosses the y-axis (the y-intercept).
[10341|p312] a What is the relationship between the x- and y-values in the table in question 1?
[10342|p312] b What equation could you use to describe the line you get when you plot the points?
[10343|p312] 3 Look at the graph. Calculate the gradient, find the  $y$ -intercept and use these to write the equation of the straight line.

[10357|p312|T1] Using equations to plot lines
[10358|p312] Keely owns a boat hire company. If Keely charges an initial fee of $40 to hire a boat and then $15 per hour, you can find a formula for the total cost...
[10359|p312] Total cost  $=$  initial fee  $^+$  total charge for all hours
[10360|p312] $$
y = 4 0 + 1 5 \times x
$$
[10361|p312] or (rearranging)
[10362|p312] $$
y = 1 5 x + 4 0
$$
[10363|p313] Now think about the total cost for a range of different hire times:
[10364|p313] one hour: cost = 15 × 1 + 40 = $55
[10365|p313] two hours: cost = 15 × 2 + 40 = $70
[10366|p313] three hours: cost = 15 × 3 + 40 = $85
[10367|p313] and so on.
[10368|p313] If you put these values (and some more) into a table you can then plot a graph of the total cost against the number of hire hours:
[10369|p313] [Table Row] <tr><td>Number of hours (x)</td><td>1</td><td>2</td><td>3</td><td>4</td><td>5</td><td>6</td><td>7</td><td>8</td><td>9</td></tr>

[10379|p314|T1] Answer
[10380|p314] Substituting the values  $-3, -2, -1, 0, 1$  and 2 into the equation gives the values in the following table:
[10381|p314] [Table Row] <tr><td>x</td><td>-3</td><td>-2</td><td>-1</td><td>0</td><td>1</td><td>2</td></tr>
[10382|p314] [Table Row] <tr><td>y</td><td>-3</td><td>-1</td><td>1</td><td>3</td><td>5</td><td>7</td></tr>
[10383|p314] Notice that the  $y$ -values range from  $-3$  to  $7$ , so your  $y$ -axis should allow for this.
[10385|p314|T1] WORKED EXAMPLE 2
[10386|p314] Draw the line with equation  $y = -x + 3$  for  $x$ -values from -2 to 5.
[10387|p314|T1] Answer
[10388|p314] The table for this line is:
[10389|p314] [Table Row] <tr><td>x</td><td>-2</td><td>-1</td><td>0</td><td>1</td><td>2</td><td>3</td><td>4</td><td>5</td></tr>

[10392|p314] To draw a graph from its equation:
[10393|p314] - construct a table of values and fill in the  $x$ - and  $y$ -coordinates of at least three points (although you may be given more)
[10394|p314] - draw and label your set of axes for the range of  $y$ -values you have worked out.
[10395|p314] - plot each point on the number plane
[10396|p314] - draw a straight line to join the points (use a ruler).
[10397|p314|T1] TIP

[10438|p315] The word 'gradient' can also be used when creating art on a computer. A colour 'gradient' refers to a gradual change from one colour to another in the...
[10439|p316] Every point on the vertical line has  $x$ -coordinate  $= 3$ . So the equation of the line is simply  $x = 3$ .
[10440|p316] Every point on the horizontal line has  $y$ -coordinate  $= -2$ . So the equation of this line is  $y = -2$ .
[10441|p316] All vertical lines are of the form:  $x =$  a number.
[10442|p316] All horizontal lines are of the form:  $y =$  a number.
[10443|p316] The gradient of a vertical line is undefined because the graph does not move right or left.
[10444|p316] The gradient of a horizontal line is zero (it does not move up or down when you move to the right).

[10453|p317] c  $y = -1$

[10466|p317] For graph (a): the  $y$ -change is 8 and the  $x$ -change is 2, so the gradient is  $\frac{8}{2} = 4$ .
[10467|p317] For graph (b): the  $y$ -change is  $-9$  (negative because you need to move down to return to the line) and the  $x$ -change is 4, so the gradient is...
[10468|p317] It is essential that you think about  $x$ -changes only. Whether the  $y$ -change is positive or negative tells you what the sign of the gradient will...
[10469|p317|T1] MATHEMATICAL CONNECTIONS
[10470|p317] You will deal with gradient as a rate of change when you work with kinematic graphs in Chapter 21.
[10471|p317|T1] TIP
[10472|p317] Another good way to remember the gradient formula is 'rise'. The 'run' must always be to the right (increase x).
[10473|p317|T1] TIP
[10474|p317] When the  $x$ -increase is 0, the line is vertical and the gradient is undefined.

[10674|p324] Perpendicular lines meet at right angles. The product of the gradients is  $-1$ .

[10844|p332] The diagram shows a rectangle of width  $(x + 3)$  cm and length  $(x + 5)$  cm that has been divided into smaller rectangles.
[10845|p332] The area of the whole rectangle is equal to the sum of the smaller areas, so the area of whole rectangle  $= (x + 3) \times (x + 5)$ .
[10846|p332] The sum of smaller rectangle areas:  $x^{2} + 3x + 5x + 15 = x^{2} + 8x + 15$ .
[10847|p332] This means that  $(x + 3) \times (x + 5) = x^2 + 3x + 5x + 15 = x^2 + 8x + 15$  and this is true for all values of  $x$ .
[10848|p332] Notice what happens if you multiply every term in the second bracket by every term in the first:
[10850|p332] Notice that the four terms in boxes are exactly the same as the four smaller areas that were calculated before.

[11024|p336] $6 + 12 = 18$  and  $6 \times 12 = 72$  so this gives  $18x$  and  $72$ .
[11025|p336] b  $(x + 4)(x - 13) = x^{2} - 9x - 52$
[11026|p336] $4 + -13 = -9$  and  $4 \times -13 = -52$  so this gives  $-9x$  and  $-52$ .

[11028|p336] Consider the expression  $x^{2} + 18x + 72$  and suppose that you want to write it in the form  $(x + a)(x + b)$ .
[11029|p336] From the worked example you know that  $a + b = 18$  and  $a \times b = 72$ .
[11030|p336] Now  $72 = 1 \times 72$  but these two numbers don't add up to give 18.
[11031|p336] However,  $72 = 6 \times 12$  and  $6 + 12 = 18$ .
[11032|p336] So,  $x^{2} + 18x + 72 = (x + 6)(x + 12)$ .
[11033|p336] The process of putting a quadratic expression back into brackets like this is called factorisation.

[11119|p338] Notice that  $x^{2} - a^{2} = x^{2} + 0x - a^{2}$ .
[11120|p338] Since  $a \times -a = -a$  and  $a + -a = 0$ , this leads to:
[11121|p338] $$
x ^ {2} - a ^ {2} = (x - a) (x + a)
$$
[11122|p338] You must remember this special case. This kind of expression is called the difference between two squares

[11126|p338] Note that the difference 'between' two squares can also be called the difference 'of' two squares. It doesn't matter which you use.
[11127|p339|T1] WORKED EXAMPLE 15
[11128|p339] Factorise the following using the difference between two squares:
[11129|p339] a  $x^{2} - 49$
[11130|p339] b x²-1 4
[11131|p339] 16y²-25w²
[11132|p339|T1] Answers
[11133|p339] a  $49 = 7^{2}$
[11134|p339] $$
\begin{array}{l} x ^ {2} - 4 9 = x ^ {2} - 7 ^ {2} \\ = (x - 7) (x + 7) \\ \end{array}
$$
[11135|p339] Use the formula for the difference between two squares:
[11136|p339] $$
x ^ {2} - a ^ {2} = (x - a) (x + a).
$$
[11137|p339] You know that  $\sqrt{49} = 7$  so you can write 49 as  $7^{2}$ . This gives you  $a^2$ . Substitute  $7^2$  into the formula.
[11138|p339] b  $\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^{2} = \frac{1}{4}$
[11139|p339] $$
\begin{array}{l} x ^ {2} - \frac {1}{4} = x ^ {2} - \left(\frac {1}{2}\right) ^ {2} \\ = \left(x - \frac {1}{2}\right) \left(x + \frac {1}{2}\right...
[11140|p339] $\sqrt{\frac{1}{4}}$  is  $\frac{1}{2}$  so you can rewrite  $\frac{1}{4}$  as  $\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^2$
[11141|p339] and substitute it into the formula for the difference between two squares.
[11142|p339] $(4y)^2 = 4y \times 4y = 16y^2$  and
[11143|p339] $$
1 6 y ^ {2} = (4 y) ^ {2}
$$
[11144|p339] $$
(5 w) ^ {2} = 5 w \times 5 w = 2 5 w ^ {2}
$$
[11145|p339] $$
2 5 w ^ {2} = (5 w) ^ {2}
$$
[11146|p339] $$
1 6 y ^ {2} - 2 5 w ^ {2} = (4 y) ^ {2} - (5 w) ^ {2}
$$
[11147|p339] Substitute in  $(4y)^2$  and  $(5w)^2$
[11148|p339] $$
= (4 y - 5 w) (4 y + 5 w)
$$
[11149|p339|T1] Perfect squares
[11150|p339] Consider what happens when you expand expressions of the form  $(a + b)^2$  and  $(a - b)^2$ .
[11151|p339] $$
(a + b) ^ {2} = (a + b) (a + b) = a ^ {2} + 2 a b + b ^ {2}
$$
[11152|p339] $$
(a - b) ^ {2} = (a - b) (a - b) = a ^ {2} - 2 a b + b ^ {2}
$$
[11153|p339] Expressions in the form  $(a + b)^2$  and  $(a - b)^2$  are perfect squares.
[11154|p339] You can use the results of the expansions in reverse to factorise expressions that follow this pattern.

[11200|p340|T1] WORKED EXAMPLE 17
[11201|p340] Solve each of the following equations for  $x$ .
[11202|p340] a  $x^{2} - 3x = 0$
[11203|p340] b  $x^{2} - 7x + 12 = 0$
[11204|p340] $x^{2} + 6x - 4 = 12$

[11207|p340] a  $x^{2} - 3x = 0$
[11208|p340] $$
x (x - 3) = 0
$$
[11209|p340] Now the key point:
[11210|p340] If two or more quantities multiply to give zero, then at least one of the quantities must be zero.
[11211|p340] So either  $x = 0$  or  $x - 3 = 0 \Rightarrow x = 3$ .
[11212|p340] Check:  $0^2 - 3 \times 0 = 0$  (this works).
[11213|p340] $3^{2} - 3 \times 3 = 9 - 9 = 0$  (this also works)
[11214|p340] In fact both  $x = 0$  and  $x = 3$  are solutions.
[11215|p340] b  $x^{2} - 7x + 12 = 0$
[11216|p340] $$
(x - 4) (x - 3) = 0
$$
[11217|p340] Therefore either  $x - 4 = 0 \Rightarrow x = 4$ .
[11218|p340] $$
\text {o r} x - 3 = 0 \Rightarrow x = 3.
$$
[11219|p340] Again, there are two possible values of  $x$ .
[11220|p340] Notice that both terms of the left-hand side are multiples of  $x$  so you can take out a common factor of  $x$ .
[11221|p340] Use the factorisation method of Worked example 14 on the left-hand side of the equation.

[11231|p341] $\Rightarrow x^{2} + 6x - 16 = 0$  (subtract 12 from both sides)
[11232|p341] Factorising, you get  $(x + 8)(x - 2) = 0$
[11233|p341] So either  $x + 8 = 0 \Rightarrow x = -8$ .
[11234|p341] or  $x - 2 = 0\Rightarrow x = 2$
[11235|p341] d Factorise  $x^{2} - 8x + 16 = 0$
[11236|p341] to give  $(x - 4)(x - 4) = 0$
[11237|p341] So either  $x - 4 = 0 \Rightarrow x = 4$ .
[11238|p341] or  $x - 4 = 0\Rightarrow x = 4$
[11239|p341] Of course these are both the same thing, so the only solution is  $x = 4$ .
[11240|p341] When you rearrange some equations with fractions you get quadratic expressions and you may have to factorise those find the solutions.

[11244|p341] Multiply both sides by  $(x + 6)(x + 2)$
[11245|p341] $$
x ^ {2} + 6 x = 8 x + 2 4

[11246|p341] Expand the brackets. Note there is now a term with  $x^2$ .

x ^ {2} - 2 x = 2 4

[11426|p348] Pythagoras' theorem describes the relationship between the sides of a right-angled triangle.
[11427|p348] The longest side – the side that does not touch the right angle – is known as the hypotenuse.
[11428|p348] For this triangle, Pythagoras' theorem states that  $a^2 + b^2 = c^2$ .

[11451|p349] Use Pythagoras' theorem to decide whether this triangle is right angled.
[11453|p349|T1] Answer
[11454|p349] Check to see if Pythagoras' theorem is satisfied:
[11455|p349] $$
c ^ {2} = a ^ {2} + b ^ {2}
$$
[11456|p349] $$
a ^ {2} + b ^ {2} = 3. 1 ^ {2} + 4. 2 ^ {2} = 2 7. 2 5
$$
[11457|p349] $$
c ^ {2} = 5. 3 ^ {2} = 2 8. 0 9 \neq 2 7. 2 5
$$
[11458|p349] Pythagoras' theorem is not satisfied, so the triangle is not right angled.
[11459|p349|T1] TIP
[11460|p349] Notice here the theorem is written as  $c^2 = a^2 + b^2$ ; you will see it written like this or as  $a^2 + b^2 = c^2$ , but it means the same thing.

[11591|p356] Explain why the two triangles shown in the diagram are similar and work out the lengths of  $x$  and  $y$ .
[11593|p356|T1] Answer
[11594|p356] Angle ACB = 180° - 27° - 108° = 45°
[11595|p356] Angle FED = 180° - 45° - 108° = 27°
[11596|p356] Both triangles have exactly the same three angles, so they are similar.
[11597|p356] Since the triangles are similar:  $\frac{DE}{AB} = \frac{EF}{BC} = \frac{DF}{AC}$
[11598|p356] So:  $\frac{y}{8} = \frac{18}{6} = 3 \Rightarrow y = 24 \mathrm{~m}$

[11606|p357|T1] Answer
[11607|p357] Consider triangles ABG and AEF:
[11610|p357] Angle BAG = FAE
[11611|p357] Common to both triangles.
[11612|p357] Angle AGB = AEF = 90°
[11613|p357] Angle ABG = AFE
[11614|p357] BG and FE are both vertical, hence parallel lines.
[11615|p357] Angles correspond.
[11616|p357] Therefore triangle ABG is similar to triangle AEF.
[11617|p357] So:  $\frac{\text{height}}{0.9} = \frac{3}{1.2} \Rightarrow \text{height} = \frac{0.9 \times 3}{1.2} = 2.25 \text{m}$

[11802|p365] Three-dimensional shapes (solids) can also be similar.

[11804|p365] Volume and surface area of similar solids
[11806|p366] The following table shows the side length and volume of each of these cubes.
[11808|p366] Notice that when the side length is multiplied by 2 the volume is multiplied by  $2^{3} = 8$ .
[11809|p366] Here, the scale factor of lengths is 2 and the scale factor of volumes is  $2^3$ .
[11810|p366] Also, when the side length is multiplied by 5 the volume is multiplied by  $5^{3} = 125$ .
[11811|p366] This time the scale factor of lengths is 5 and the scale factor of volumes is  $5^3$ .
[11812|p366] In fact, this pattern is true in the general case:
[11813|p366] Scale factor of volumes  $=$  (scale factor of lengths)
[11814|p366] By considering the surface areas of the cubes you can also see that the rule about the scale factor of areas is still true:
[11815|p366] Scale factor of areas  $=$  (scale factor of lengths)²
[11816|p366] In summary, if two solids  $(A$  and  $B$  ) are similar:
[11817|p366] the ratio of their volumes is equal to the cube of the ratio of corresponding lengths (edges, diameter, radii, heights and slant heights). In other wo...

[11824|p366|T1] Answer
[11825|p366] Scale factor of lengths  $= \frac{12}{3} = 4$ $\Rightarrow$  Scale factor of volumes  $= 4^{3} = 64$
[11826|p366] So the volume of the larger cone  $= 64 \times 40 = 2560 \, \text{cm}^3$ .

[11978|p374] The longest side of a right-angled triangle is called the hypotenuse.

[11980|p374] Similar shapes have equal corresponding angles and the ratios of corresponding sides are equal.
[11981|p374] If shapes are similar and the lengths of one shape are multiplied by a scale factor of  $n$ :
[11982|p374] then the areas are multiplied by a scale factor of  $n^2$
[11983|p374] and the volumes are multiplied by a scale factor of  $n^3$

[12064|p378|T1] 12.1 Different types of average
[12065|p378] The shoe sizes of 19 students in a class are:
[12066|p378] 47667486811686356764
[12067|p378] How would you describe the shape sizes in this class?
[12068|p378] Sometimes you might want to represent a set of data with a single value. When you do this, you use an average value.
[12069|p378] There are three main types of average used in statistics and you can use each of them to describe the shoe sizes for the class.
[12070|p378] The is the value that occurs the most often. If you count how times each shoe size occurs in the class, you will find that the most common (most frequ...

[12115|p380] The value  $128.9\mathrm{km/h}$  seems much faster than any other car. How does this extreme value affect your averages?
[12116|p380] You can check yourself that the mean of the above data including the extreme value is  $70.7\mathrm{km / h}$
[12117|p380] This average is larger than all but one of the values and is not representative of the data. This means that in this situation the mean might be a poo...

[12280|p387] The total of all 100 throws is the sum of all values in this third column:
[12281|p387] $$
\begin{array}{l} \text {T o t a l s c o r e} = 1 6 + 2 6 + 4 2 + 6 8 + 9 5 + 1 2 6 \\ = 3 7 3 \\ \end{array}
$$
[12282|p387] So the mean score per throw  $= \frac{\text{total score}}{\text{total number of throws}} = \frac{373}{100} = 3.73$ .

[12494|p395] 1568810111212131416
[12495|p395] There are an even number of items (12). So, to find the median, find the mean of the middle pair. The first of the pair is in position  $\frac{12}{2} ...
[12496|p395] Calculate the position of the quartiles:
[12497|p395] $$
\frac {1}{4} (1 2 + 1) = 3. 2 5 \text {a n d} \frac {3}{4} (1 2 + 1) = 9. 7 5
$$
[12498|p395] These are not whole numbers, so the lower quartile is the mean of the 3rd and 4th values, and the upper quartile is the mean of the 9th and 10th value...
[12499|p395] $$
Q _ {1} \frac {(6 + 8)}{2} = 7 \text {a n d} Q _ {3} = \frac {(1 2 + 1 3)}{2} = 1 2. 5
$$
[12500|p395] Then you know that the IQR = 12.5 - 7 = 5.5.
[12501|p395] b The ordered data is:
[12502|p395] 891014141519
[12503|p395] There is an odd number of data values, so the median is in position  $\frac{(7 + 1)}{2} = 4$ . The median is 14.
[12504|p395|T1] MATHEMATICAL CONNECTIONS
[12505|p395] In Chapter 20 you will learn about cumulative frequency graphs. These allow you to calculate estimates for the median and quartiles when there are too...
[12506|p396|T1] WORKED EXAMPLE 5 CONTINUED
[12507|p396] There are seven items, so the positions of the quartiles are:  $\frac{1}{4} (7 + 1) = 2$  and  $\frac{3}{4} (7 + 1) = 6$ .
[12508|p396] These are whole numbers so the lower quartile is in position two and the upper quartile is in position six.
[12509|p396] So  $Q_{1} = 9$  and  $Q_{3} = 15$ .
[12510|p396] IQR=15-9=6

[12627|p400] Averages - the mode, median and mean - are used to summarise a collection of data.
[12628|p400] Discrete data can be listed or arranged in a frequency distribution.
[12629|p400] Continuous data can be listed or arranged into groups.
[12630|p400] The mean is affected by extreme data.
[12631|p400] The median is less affected by extreme data.
[12632|p400] The lower quartile  $(Q_{1})$  lies  $25\%$  of the way through the data.
[12633|p400] The upper quartile  $(Q_{1})$  lies  $75\%$  of the way through the data.
[12634|p400] The interquartile range  $(\mathrm{IQR} = \mathrm{Q}_3 - \mathrm{Q}_1)$  gives a measure of how spread out or consistent the central  $50\%$  of the d...

[12922|p414|T1] Answers
[12923|p414] a  $1\mathrm{km} = 1000\mathrm{m} = 1000\times 100\mathrm{cm} = 100000\mathrm{cm}$
[12924|p414] So.  $5\mathrm{km} = 5\times 100000\mathrm{cm} = 500000\mathrm{cm}$
[12925|p414] b  $100\mathrm{cm} = 1\mathrm{m}$  so  $1\mathrm{cm} = 0.01\mathrm{m}$
[12926|p414] So,  $3.2\mathrm{cm} = 3.2 \times 0.01 = 0.032\mathrm{m}$
[12927|p414] $1\mathrm{m}^2 = 100\mathrm{cm}\times 100\mathrm{cm} = 10000\mathrm{cm}^2$

[13032|p417] How much time passes from 19:35 on Monday to 03:55 on Tuesday?
[13033|p417|T1] Answer
[13034|p417] 19:35 to 24:00 is one part and 00:00 to 03:55 the next day is the other part.
[13035|p417] A good way to start this problem is to divide the time into parts.
[13036|p417|T1] Part one:
[13037|p417] 19:35 to 20:00 is 25 minutes  
20:00 to 24:00 is 4 hours  
So, 19:35 to 24:00 is 4 h 25 min
[13038|p417] Work out how much time passes to reach midnight.
[13039|p417|T1] Part two:
[13040|p417] 0:00 to 03:55 is 3 h 55 min
[13041|p417] 03:55 is 3 hours and 55 minutes past midnight.
[13042|p417] 4h 25min + 3h 55min = 7h 80min = 8h 20min
[13043|p417] Add the result of the two parts together.
[13044|p417] The total time is 8 hours and 20 minutes.
[13045|p417] 80 minutes = 1 hour 20 minutes

\begin{array}{l} = 3. 6 5 + 1 4. 5 \\ = 1 8. 1 5 \\ \end{array}
$$
[13245|p425] Lower bound for  $(a + b) =$  lower bound for  $a +$  lower bound for  $b$
[13246|p425] $$
\begin{array}{l} = 3. 5 5 + 1 3. 5 \\ = 1 7. 0 5 \\ \end{array}
$$
[13247|p425] You can write this as:  $17.05 \leqslant (a + b) < 18.15$
[13248|p425] b Upper bound for ab = upper bound for a  $\times$  upper bound for b
[13249|p425] $$
\begin{array}{l} = 3. 6 5 \times 1 4. 5 \\ = 5 2. 9 2 5 \\ \end{array}
$$
[13250|p425] Lower bound for  $ab =$  lower bound of  $a \times$  lower bound of  $b$
[13251|p425] $$
\begin{array}{l} = 3. 5 5 \times 1 3. 5 \\ = 4 7. 9 2 5 \\ \end{array}
$$
[13252|p425] You can write this as:  $47.925 \leqslant ab < 52.925$
[13253|p425] c Think carefully about  $b - a$  .To find the upper bound you need to subtract the smallest possible number from the largest possible number. So:
[13254|p425] Upper bound for  $(b - a) =$  upper bound for  $b -$  lower bound for a
[13255|p425] $$
\begin{array}{l} = 1 4. 5 - 3. 5 5 \\ = 1 0. 9 5 \\ \end{array}
$$
[13256|p425] For the lower bound, subtract the largest possible number from the smallest possible number:
[13257|p425] Lower bound for  $(b - a) =$  lower bound for  $b$  - upper bound for a
[13258|p425] $$
\begin{array}{l} = 1 3. 5 - 3. 6 5 \\ = 9. 8 5 \\ \end{array}
$$
[13259|p425] You can write this as:  $9.85 \leqslant (b - a) < 10.95$
[13260|p425] d To find the upper bound of  $\frac{a}{b}$  you need to divide the largest possible value of  $a$  by the smallest possible value of  $b$ :
[13261|p425] $$
\text {U p p e r b o u n d} = \frac {\text {u p p e r b o u n d f o r a}}{\text {l o w e r b o u n d f o r b}} = \frac {3 . 6 5}{1 3 . 5} = 0. 2 7 ...

[13598|p441|T1] WORKED EXAMPLE 1
[13599|p441] By drawing the graphs of each of the following equations on the same pair of axes, find the simultaneous solutions to the equations.
[13600|p441] $$
\begin{array}{l} x - 3 y = 6 \\ 2 x + y = 5 \\ \end{array}
$$
[13601|p441|T1] Answer
[13603|p441] For the first equation:
[13604|p441] $$
\begin{array}{l} i f x = 0, - 3 y = 6 \Rightarrow y = - 2 \\ a n d, i f y = 0, x = 6 \\ \end{array}
$$
[13605|p441] So this line passes through the points  $(0, -2)$  and  $(6, 0)$ .
[13606|p441] For the second equation:
[13607|p441] $$
i f x = 0, y = 5
$$
[13608|p441] $$
\text {a n d , i f} y = 0, 2 x = 5 \Rightarrow x = \frac {5}{2}
$$
[13609|p441] So this line passes through the points (0, 5) and  $\left(\frac{5}{2}, 0\right)$ .
[13610|p441] Plot the pairs of points and draw lines through them.
[13611|p441] Notice that the two lines meet at the point with coordinates  $(3, -1)$ .
[13612|p441] So, the solution to the pair of equations is  $x = 3$  and  $y = -1$ .

[13676|p443] Solve equation [2] for  $y$ .
[13677|p443] Label the new equation [3].
[13678|p443] [1]
[13679|p443] Substitute [3] into [1] by replacing  $y$  with  $24 - 4x$
[13680|p443] Remove brackets.
[13681|p443] Add 48 to both sides.
[13682|p443] Add like terms.
[13683|p443] Divide both sides by 11.
[13684|p443] Now, substitute the value of  $x$  into any of the

[13686|p443] so use this one.
[13687|p443] Write out the solutions.
[13688|p443|T1] MATHEMATICAL CONNECTIONS
[13689|p443] The substitution method involves rearranging formulae to make one of the variables the subject. You learnt how to do this in Chapter 6.
[13690|p443|T1] TIP
[13691|p443] You should always number the
[13692|p443] equations so you
[13693|p443] can identify each
[13694|p443] equation quickly
[13695|p443] and easily.
[13696|p444|T1] Solving by elimination
[13697|p444] You can also solve simultaneous equations by eliminating (getting rid of) one of the variables.
[13698|p444|T1] WORKED EXAMPLE 3

[13700|p444] $$
x - y = 4 \tag {1}
$$
[13701|p444] $$
x + y = 6 \tag {2}
$$
[13702|p444|T1] Answer
[13703|p444] $x - y = 4$  [1] You can add the two equations together by adding the  $x + y = 6$  [2] left-hand sides and adding the right-hand sides.
[13704|p444] $$
2 x = 1 0
$$
[13705|p444] $$
\begin{array}{l} 2 x = 1 0 \\ \Rightarrow x = \frac {1 0}{2} \\ x = 5 \\ \end{array}
$$
[13706|p444] Notice that the equation that comes from this addition no longer contains a  $y$  term, so you can now solve to find the value of  $x$ .
[13707|p444] $x + y = 6$  [2] You now need to find the  $y$  -value that goes with this  $5 + y = 6$  value of  $x$  .Substitute  $x$  into equation [2].

y = 1

4 x + 3 y = - 4 \quad [ 2 ]
$$
[13758|p446] $$
4 x - 1 0 y = 4 8 \tag {3}

[13759|p446] Equations [2] and [3] have the same coefficient of  $x$ , so write these equations together and solve as before.
[13760|p446] $$
4 x + 3 y = - 4 [ 2 ] - [ 3 ]

[13984|p453] Now, suppose that  $x = 2$ , then  $3x = 6$  but this doesn't quite satisfy the inequality! However, any value of  $x$  that is larger than 2 will wor...
[13985|p453] If  $x = 2.1$ , then  $3x = 6.3$ , which is greater than 6.
[13986|p453] In the same way that you could divide both sides of an equation by 3, both sides of the inequality can be divided by 3 to get the solution:
[13987|p453] $$
\begin{array}{l} 3 x > 6 \\ \frac {3 x}{3} > \frac {6}{3} \\ x > 2 \end{array}
$$
[13988|p453] Notice that this solution is a range of values of  $x$  rather than a single value. Any value of  $x$  that is greater than 2 is a solution.
[13989|p453] You can solve any linear inequality in a similar way to how you would solve a linear equation. But there are important exceptions, which are described...
[13990|p453|T1] WORKED EXAMPLE 10

[13997|p453|T1] Answers
[13998|p453] a  $3x - 4 <   14$
[13999|p453] $$
3 x <   1 8
$$
[14000|p453] Add 4 to both sides.
[14001|p453] $$
\frac {3 x}{3} <   \frac {1 8}{3}
$$
[14002|p453] Divide both sides by 3.
[14003|p453] $$
\mathrm {S o}, x <   6

[14004|p453] b  $4(x - 7)\geq 16$
[14005|p453] $4x - 28\geq 16$
[14006|p453] $$
4 x \geqslant 4 4
$$
[14007|p453] $$
\frac {4 x}{4} \geqslant \frac {4 4}{4}
$$
[14008|p453] $$
\mathrm {S o}, x \geqslant 1 1
$$
[14009|p453] $$
4 (x - 7) \geqslant 1 6
$$
[14010|p453] $$
x - 7 \geqslant 4
$$
[14011|p453] $$
x \geqslant 1 1
$$
[14012|p453] Expand the brackets.
[14013|p453] Add 28 to both sides.
[14014|p453] Divide both sides by 4.
[14015|p453] You can also solve this inequality by dividing both sides by 4 at the beginning:
[14016|p453] Divide both sides by 4.
[14017|p453] Add 7 to both sides to get the same answer as before.

[14019|p453] There is a clear relationship between this method and how you solved equations in Chapter 6.
[14020|p454|T1] WORKED EXAMPLE 10 CONTINUED
[14021|p454] c  $5x - 3\leqslant 2x + 18$
[14022|p454] $$
\begin{array}{l} 5 x - 3 - 2 x \leqslant 2 x + 1 8 - 2 x \\ 3 x - 3 \leqslant 1 8 \\ 3 x \leqslant 2 1 \\ x \leqslant 7 \\ \end{array}
$$
[14023|p454] Subtract the smaller number of  $x$ 's from both sides (2x).
[14024|p454] Simplify.
[14025|p454] Add 3 to both sides.
[14026|p454] Divide both sides by 3.
[14027|p454] d  $4 - 7x\leqslant 53$
[14028|p454] $$
4 \leqslant 5 3 + 7 x
$$
[14029|p454] $$
- 4 9 \leqslant 7 x
$$
[14030|p454] $$
- 7 \leqslant x
$$
[14031|p454] And,  $x\geq -7$
[14032|p454] Add 7x to both sides
[14033|p454] Subtract 53 from both sides.
[14034|p454] Divide both sides by 7.
[14035|p454] The  $x$  is on the right-hand side of the inequality in this answer. This is acceptable. You can reverse the entire inequality to place the  $x$  on ...
[14036|p454] e  $-10\leqslant 3x - 2 <   4$

[14038|p454] There are three parts to this inequality.
[14039|p454] Split into two inequalities.
[14040|p454] Solve each part.
[14041|p454] Recombine the solutions.
[14042|p454|T1] A warning
[14043|p454] Before working through the next exercise you must understand and apply one further rule. Think about this inequality:
[14044|p454] $$
\begin{array}{l} 3 - 5 x > 1 8 \\ \Rightarrow - 5 x > 1 5 \\ \end{array}
$$
[14045|p454] If you divide both sides by  $-5$  it appears that the solution will be,
[14046|p454] $$
x > - 3
$$
[14047|p454] This is satisfied by any value of  $x$  that is greater than -3, for example -2, -1, 2.4, 3.5, 10 ...
[14048|p454] If you calculate the value of  $3 - 5x$  for each of these values you get 13, 8, -9, -14.5, -47 ... and not one of these works in the original inequal...
[14049|p454] Here is an alternative solution:
[14050|p454] $$
3 - 5 x > 1 8
$$
[14051|p454] $$
\begin{array}{l} \Rightarrow \quad 3 > 1 8 + 5 x \\ - 1 5 > 5 x \\ - 3 > x \\ \end{array}
$$
[14052|p454] $$
\text {O r}, \quad x <   - 3
$$
[14053|p454] This is a correct solution, and the final answer is very similar to the 'wrong' one above.
[14054|p454] The only difference is that the inequality symbol has been reversed.
[14055|p455] Why does this happen? When you multiply both sides by a negative value, the side that was greater will end up being a 'bigger' negative number, which ...
[14056|p455] You need to remember the following:
[14057|p455] If you multiply or divide both sides of an inequality by a negative number then you must reverse the direction of the inequality.
[14058|p455] If you can avoid negatives, by adding or subtracting terms, then try to do so.

[14232|p464] a Try  $(x + 2)^2 = x^2 + 4x + 4$
[14233|p464] The coefficient of  $x$  in  $x^2 + 4x - 6$  is 4. Half of this is 2.
[14234|p464] $$
\begin{array}{l} (x + 2) ^ {2} - 1 0 = x ^ {2} + 4 x + 4 - 1 0 \\ = x ^ {2} + 4 x - 6 \\ \end{array}
$$
[14235|p464] Subtract 10 from both sides to make the constant term  $-6$ .
[14236|p464] b  $x^{2} + 4x - 6 = 0$
[14237|p464] $$
\begin{array}{l} (x + 2) ^ {2} - 1 0 = 0 \\ (x + 2) ^ {2} = 1 0 \\ x + 2 = \pm \sqrt {1 0} \\ x = - 2 \pm \sqrt {1 0} \\ \end{array}

[14459|p470] Try each of these combinations systematically:
[14460|p470] $(2x - 1)(x - 1) = 2x^{2} - 3x + 1$
[14461|p470] The coefficient of  $x$  is wrong.
[14462|p470] $(2x + 1)(x + 1) = 2x^{2} + 3x + 1$
[14463|p470] This is correct.
[14464|p470] So,  $2x^{2} + 3x + 1 = (2x + 1)(x + 1)$
[14466|p471|T1] WORKED EXAMPLE 21 CONTINUED
[14467|p471] b  $3x^{2} - 14x + 8$
[14468|p471] Start by writing  $3x^{2} - 14x + 8 = (3x)(x)$
[14469|p471] The two unknown terms must multiply to give 8. Since the constant term is positive, the unknowns must have the same sign. The possible pairs are:
[14470|p471] 8 and 1 2 and 4 -8 and -1 -2 and -4
[14471|p471] Try each pair in turn, remembering that you can reverse the order:
[14472|p471] $$
(3 x + 8) (x + 1) = 3 x ^ {2} + 3 x + 8 x + 8 = 3 x ^ {2} + 1 1 x + 8 \quad \text {I n c o r r e c t}
$$
[14473|p471] $$
(3 x + 1) (x + 8) = 3 x ^ {2} + 2 4 x + x + 8 = 3 x ^ {2} + 2 5 x + 8 \quad \text {I n c o r r e c t}
$$
[14474|p471] $$
(3 x + 2) (x + 4) = 3 x ^ {2} + 1 2 x + 2 x + 8 = 3 x ^ {2} + 1 4 x + 8 \quad \text {I n c o r r e c t}
$$
[14475|p471] This last one is very close. You just need to change the sign of the 'x' term. This can be done by jumping to the last pair: -2 and -4.
[14476|p471] $$
(3 x - 2) (x - 4) = 3 x ^ {2} - 1 2 x - 2 x + 8 = 3 x ^ {2} - 1 4 x + 8 \quad \text {C o r r e c t}
$$
[14477|p471] $$
S _ {0}, 3 x ^ {2} - 1 4 x + 8 = (3 x - 2) (x - 4)
$$
[14478|p471] c  $6x^{2} + 14x - 12 = 2(3x^{2} + 7x - 6)$  Take out the common factor first.
[14479|p471] Write the pair of brackets; the factors have to be  $3x$  and  $x$ :
[14480|p471] $$
6 x ^ {2} + 1 4 x - 1 2 = 2 (3 x) (x)
$$
[14481|p471] The two unknown terms must multiply to give  $-6$ , because you have taken out the common factor 2. The possible pairs are:
[14482|p471] 2 and -3 3 and -2 6 and -1 -6 and 1
[14483|p471] Test the pairs until you find the correct combination.
[14484|p471] You will find that:
[14485|p471] $$
6 x ^ {2} + 1 4 x - 1 2 = 2 (3 x - 2) (x + 3)
$$
[14486|p471] d  $10x^{2} + 11x - 8$
[14487|p471] This question requires more thought because there is more than one way to multiply two expressions to get  $10x^{2}$ :
[14488|p471] 2x and 5x or 10x and x.
[14489|p471] Each possibility needs to be tried.
[14490|p471] Start with  $10x^{2} + 11x - 8 = (10x)(x)$
[14491|p471] Factor pairs that multiply to give -8 are:
[14492|p471] -8 and 1 8 and -1 2 and -4 -2 and 4
[14493|p471] Remember that you will need to try each pair with the two values in either order.
[14494|p471] For this particular quadratic you will find that none of the eight possible combinations works!
[14495|p471] Instead, you must now try:  $10x^{2} + 11x - 8 = (5x)(2x)$ .
[14496|p471] Trying the above set of pairs once again you will eventually find that:
[14497|p471] $$
1 0 x ^ {2} + 1 1 x - 8 = (5 x + 8) (2 x - 1)

[14517|p472] Factorise  $10x^{2} + 11x - 8$
[14518|p472|T1] Answer
[14519|p472] $10 \times -8 = -80$
[14520|p472] Multiply the coefficient of  $x^2$  by the constant term.
[14521|p472] -1, 80 (no)
[14522|p472] List the factor pairs of -80 until you obtain a pair that totals the coefficient of  $x$ , which is 11.
[14523|p472] -2, 40 (no)
[14524|p472] (Note that as 11 is positive and -80 is negative, the larger number of the pair must be positive and the other negative.)
[14525|p472] $10x^{2} - 5x + 16x - 8$
[14526|p472] Rewrite the  $x$  term using this factor pair.
[14527|p472] $5x(2x - 1) + 8(2x - 1)$
[14528|p472] Factorise pairs of terms.
[14529|p472] $(5x + 8)(2x - 1)$
[14530|p472] (Be careful with signs here so that the second bracket is the same as the first bracket.)

[14561|p473|T1] Answers
[14562|p473] a  $\frac{3x}{6}$
[14563|p473] $$
\frac {3 x}{6} = \frac {3 x \div 3}{6 \div 3} = \frac {x}{2}
$$
[14564|p473] The highest common factor (HCF) of 3 and 6 is 3.
[14565|p473] b  $\frac{y^2}{y^5}$
[14566|p473] $$
\frac {y ^ {2}}{y ^ {5}} = \frac {y ^ {2} \div y ^ {2}}{y ^ {5} \div y ^ {2}} = \frac {1}{y ^ {3}}
$$
[14567|p473] The HCF of  $y^{2}$  and  $y^{3}$  is  $y^{2}$ .
[14568|p473] 12p3 16p7
[14569|p473] $$
\frac {1 2 p ^ {3}}{1 6 p ^ {7}} = \frac {3 p ^ {3}}{4 p ^ {7}}

[14570|p473] Consider the constants first.
[14571|p473] $$
= \frac {3}{4 p ^ {4}}
$$
[14572|p473] The HCF of 12 and 16 is 4, so you can divide both 12 and 16 by 4.
[14573|p473] The HCF of  $p^3$  and  $p^7$  is  $p^3$ . You can divide both the numerator and the denominator by this HCF.
[14574|p473] d  $\frac{x^2 - 4x + 3}{x^2 - 7x + 12}$
[14575|p473] Notice that you can factorise both the numerator and the denominator.

\begin{array}{l} \frac {x ^ {2} - 4 x + 3}{x ^ {2} - 7 x + 1 2} = \frac {(x - 3) (x - 1)}{(x - 3) (x - 4)} \\ = \frac {(x - 3) (x - 1)}{(x - 3) (x ...

[14831|p484|T1] Answer
[14832|p484] 10m is represented by 1cm
[14833|p484] :  $100\mathrm{m}$  is represented by  $(100\div 10)\mathrm{cm} = 10\mathrm{cm}$
[14834|p484] and  $45\mathrm{m}$  is represented by  $(45\div 10)\mathrm{cm} = 4.5\mathrm{cm}$

[14879|p487] The angle  $118^{\circ}$ , shown on the right, is measured clockwise from the north direction. Such an angle is called a bearing.
[14880|p487] All bearings are measured clockwise from the north direction.
[14881|p487] Here the bearing of  $P$  from  $O$  is  $118^{\circ}$
[14882|p487|T1] MATHEMATICAL CONNECTIONS

[14884|p487] If the angle is less than  $100^{\circ}$  you still use three figures so that it is clear that you mean to use a bearing.
[14885|p487] Here the bearing of  $Q$  from  $O$  is  $040^{\circ}$
[14888|p487] Since you always measure clockwise from north it is possible for your bearing to be a reflex angle.
[14889|p487] Here the bearing of  $R$  from  $O$  is  $315^{\circ}$
[14891|p487|T1] MATHEMATICAL CONNECTIONS
[14892|p487] You saw in Chapter 3 that a reflex angle is  $>180^{\circ}$  but  $< 360^{\circ}$ .
[14893|p487] You may sometimes need to use angle properties from previous chapters to solve bearings problems.

[14895|p488] The bearing of town B from city A is  $048^{\circ}$ . What is the bearing of city A from town B?
[14898|p488|T1] Answer
[14899|p488] In the second diagram, the two north lines are parallel. Hence angle  $\theta = 48^{\circ}$  (using the properties of corresponding angles).
[14900|p488] The bearing of city A from town  $B = 48^{\circ} + 180^{\circ} = 228^{\circ}$
[14901|p488] Notice that the difference between the two bearings  $(48^{\circ}$  and  $228^{\circ})$  is  $180^{\circ}$
[14902|p488|T1] TIP
[14903|p488] Always make sure that you draw a clear diagram and mark all north lines clearly. Bearings should always be measured from north.

\begin{array}{l} x + x + x = 1 8 0 ^ {\circ} \\ \Rightarrow \quad 3 x = 1 8 0 ^ {\circ} \\ x = \frac {1 8 0 ^ {\circ}}{3} = 6 0 ^ {\circ} \\ \end{a...
[15366|p506] Isosceles right-angled triangles contain one  $90^{\circ}$  angle and two  $45^{\circ}$  angles:
[15368|p506] $$
\begin{array}{l} y + y + 9 0 ^ {\circ} = 1 8 0 ^ {\circ} \\ \Rightarrow \quad 2 y = 9 0 ^ {\circ} \\ \Rightarrow \quad y = \frac {9 0 ^ {\circ}}{2}...
[15369|p506] Think about an isosceles right-angled triangle, where the two shorter sides are both 1 cm long.
[15371|p506] By Pythagoras' theorem:
[15372|p506] $$
\begin{array}{l} d ^ {2} = 1 ^ {2} + 1 ^ {2} = 2 \\ \Rightarrow d = \sqrt {2} \\ \end{array}
$$
[15373|p507] This means that  $d$  is the exact length of the hypotenuse, which you can now use to find the exact values of some trigonometric ratios:
[15374|p507] $$
\sin 4 5 ^ {\circ} = \frac {\text {o p p o s i t e}}{\text {h y p o t e n u s e}} = \frac {1}{\sqrt {2}}

$$
[15376|p507] $$
\tan 4 5 ^ {\circ} = \frac {\text {o p p o s i t e}}{\text {a d j a c e n t}} = \frac {1}{1} = 1
$$
[15377|p507] $$

[15458|p511] By symmetry,  $ND = BM = 2.3\mathrm{cm}$

[15475|p512] The right-angled triangles  $ABM$  and  $CDN$  are congruent, so  $AM = NC$ .
[15476|p512] When the two halves are lowered, they must meet in the middle.

[15550|p516|T1] The graph of  $y = \sin \theta$
[15551|p516] If you plot several values of  $\sin \theta$  against  $\theta$  you will get the following:
[15553|p517] The graph repeats itself every  $360^{\circ}$  in both the positive and negative directions.
[15554|p517] Notice that the section of the graph between 0 and  $180^{\circ}$  has reflection symmetry, with the line of reflection being  $\theta = 90^{\circ}$ ....

[15559|p517] If you plot several values of  $\cos \theta$  against  $\theta$  you will get a similar shape, but the line of symmetry is in a different place:
[15561|p517] The graph repeats itself every  $360^{\circ}$  in both the positive and negative directions.
[15562|p517] Here the graph is symmetrical from 0 to  $360^{\circ}$ , with the reflection line at  $\theta = 180^{\circ}$ . This means that  $\cos \theta = \cos (3...

[15565|p518] Finally, if you plot values of  $\tan \theta$  against  $\theta$  you get this graph:
[15567|p518] The graph approaches the vertical dotted lines, but it never touches nor crosses them.
[15568|p518] Notice that this graph has no reflection symmetry, but it does repeat every  $180^{\circ}$ . This means that  $\tan \theta = \tan (180^{\circ} + \thet...

\frac {\sin A}{a} = \frac {\sin B}{b} \text {a n d} \frac {\sin A}{a} = \frac {\sin C}{c} \text {a n d} \frac {\sin B}{b} = \frac {\sin C}{c}
$$
[15674|p521] These relationships are usually expressed in one go:
[15675|p521] $$
\frac {\sin A}{a} = \frac {\sin B}{b} = \frac {\sin C}{c}
$$
[15676|p521] This is the sine rule. This version of the rule, with the sine ratios placed on the tops of the fractions, is normally used to calculate angles.
[15677|p521] The formulae can also be turned upside down when you want to calculate lengths:
[15678|p521] $$
\frac {a}{\sin A} = \frac {b}{\sin B} = \frac {c}{\sin C}

[15688|p522|T1] Answer
[15689|p522] To calculate the angle  $C$ , use the fact that the sum of the three angles in a triangle is always  $180^\circ$

S o, C + 8 0 + 3 0 = 1 8 0 \Rightarrow C = 1 8 0 - 3 0 - 8 0 = 7 0 ^ {\circ}

[15708|p523|T1] Answers
[15709|p523] a Angle DEF is opposite a side of length 10cm. This forms one pair.
[15710|p523] Angle EDF is opposite a side of length  $7\mathrm{cm}$  . This forms the second pair.
[15711|p523] You are trying to find an angle, so choose the version of the sine rule with the value of sine ratios in the numerators:
[15712|p523] $$
\frac {\sin 3 4 ^ {\circ}}{7} = \frac {\sin E}{1 0} \Rightarrow \sin E = 1 0 \times \frac {\sin 3 4 ^ {\circ}}{7}
$$
[15713|p523] So, angle  $DEF = \sin^{-1}\left(10 \times \frac{\sin 34^\circ}{7}\right) = 53.0^\circ$
[15714|p523] But there is actually a second angle DEF such that  $\sin E = 10 \times \frac{\sin 34^\circ}{7}$ .
[15715|p523] You can see this if you consider the sine graph. The values of both  $\sin x$  and  $\cos x$  repeat every  $360^{\circ}$ . This property of both func...
[15716|p523] Both of these are possible values of angle DEF because there are two ways to draw such a triangle.
[15718|p523] b Of course, the answers to part (a) must lead to two possible answers for part (b).
[15719|p523] If angle  $DEF = 127.0^{\circ}$ , then angle  $DFE = 180^{\circ} - 127^{\circ} - 34^{\circ} = 19^{\circ}$  (shown as  $E_{1}$  in the diagram).
[15720|p523] If angle  $DEF = 53.0^{\circ}$ , then angle  $DFE = 180^{\circ} - 53^{\circ} - 34^{\circ} = 93^{\circ}$  (shown as  $E_{2}$  in the diagram).
[15721|p523] (If you had been asked for the length  $DE$ , there would also have been two possible solutions.)

[15864|p531] Now note that  $\mathrm{opp}(C) = h$  and the hypotenuse  $= a$ .
[15865|p531] Using the sine ratio:  $\sin C = \frac{h}{a} \Rightarrow h = a \sin C$
[15866|p531] This means that you now know the perpendicular height and can use the base length  $b$  to calculate the area:
[15867|p531] $$
\begin{array}{l} \text {A r e a} = \frac {1}{2} \times \text {b a s e} \times \text {p e r p e n d i c u l a r h e i g h t} \\ = \frac {1}{2} \time...

[15920|p534] - If  $PQ$  is perpendicular to the plane, all these angles will be right angles.
[15921|p534] If  $PQ$  is not perpendicular to the plane, these angles will vary in size.
[15922|p534] It is the smallest of these angles which is called the angle between the line  $PQ$  and the plane  $ABCD$ .
[15923|p534] To identify this angle, do the following:
[15924|p534] From  $Q$  draw a perpendicular to the plane. Call the foot of this perpendicular  $R$ .
[15925|p534] The angle between the line  $PO$  and the plane is angle  $OPR$

[15932|p535|T1] Answer
[15933|p535] First identify the angle required.  $B$  is the point where the diagonal BS meets the plane ABCD.
[15934|p535] ${SD}$  is the perpendicular from  $S$  to the plane  ${ABCD}$  and so  ${DB}$  is the projection of  ${SB}$  onto the plane.
[15936|p535] The angle required is SBD.
[15937|p535] You know that triangle SBD has a right angle at  $D$  and that  $SD = 2m$  (equal to AP).
[15938|p535] To find angle SBD, you need to know the length of DB or the length of SB. You can find the length of BD by using Pythagoras' theorem in triangle ABD.
[15940|p535] $$
\begin{array}{l} B D ^ {2} = 6 ^ {2} + 4 ^ {2} = 3 6 + 1 6 = 5 2 \\ B D = \sqrt {5 2} \\ \end{array}

[15941|p535] So, using right-angled triangle SBD:

\tan B = \frac {\operatorname {o p p} (B)}{\operatorname {a d j} (B)} = \frac {S D}{B D} = \frac {2}{\sqrt {5 2}}

[16124|p544] Correlations are used to investigate possible relationships between variables in many subjects where measurements are taken. For example, a biologist ...
[16125|p544] In the example of the ice cream shop, it seems sensible that the total sales will depend on the temperature, so plot the sales on the vertical axis.
[16126|p544|T1] TIP
[16127|p544] If you are told to plot A against B, then you should plot A on the vertical axis and B on the horizontal axis.
[16129|p545] Notice that there seems to be a relationship between the ice cream sales and the temperature. In fact, the sales rise as the temperature rises. This i...
[16130|p545] If the points been placed from the top left to bottom right you would conclude that the sales decrease as the temperature increases. Under these circu...

[16137|p545] You should always be ready to state whether a correlation is positive, negative, strong or weak.

[16139|p546|T1] Drawing a line of best fit
[16140|p546] You can also show the general trend by drawing a line of best fit. In the diagram a line has been drawn so that it passes as close to as many points a...
[16142|p546] This is the line of best fit and you can use it to make predictions based on the collected data.
[16143|p546] For example, if you want to try to predict the ice cream sales on a day with a temperature of  $27^{\circ}C$ , you carry out the following steps:
[16144|p546] 1. Locate  $27^{\circ}C$  on the temperature axis.
[16145|p546] 2 Draw a clear line vertically from this point to the line of best fit.
[16146|p546] 3 Draw a horizontal line from the point on the line of best fit to the sales axis.
[16147|p546] 4 Read the sales value from the graph.
[16148|p546] The diagram now looks like this and the estimated value for the sales is approximately $575.

[16407|p561] Consider an imaginary three-dimensional game where two players take it in turn to place different coloured marbles into a box.
[16408|p561] The box is made from 27 transparent unit cubes arranged in a 3-by-3-by-3 array.
[16410|p561] The aim of the game is to make a winning row of three of your own marbles. Rows can be horizontal, vertical or diagonal.
[16411|p561] This diagram shows the placement of one winning row. The marbles are on three levels and the row is diagonal.
[16413|p561] How many different ways are there to make a winning row?

[16466|p564] - Piece work - pay based on the number of items produced.
[16467|p564] - Commission - pay is based on a percentage of sales made; sometimes a low wage, called a retainer, is paid as well as commission.

[16476|p564] b How much would he earn if he sold four phones at 3299 Dhs each in a week?
[16477|p564|T1] Answers
[16478|p564] a 800 Dhs
[16479|p564] If he made no sales, he would earn no commission, only his retainer.
[16480|p564] b Commission  $= 4.5\%$  of  $(3299\times 4)$
[16481|p564] Calculate  $4.5\%$  of the total sales Sanjay made.
[16482|p564] $= 0.045\times 13196$
[16483|p564] $= 593.82$  Dhs
[16484|p564] Earnings  $=$  retainer  $^+$  commission
[16485|p564] $= 800\mathrm{Dhs} + 593.82\mathrm{Dhs}$
[16486|p564] $= 1393.82\mathrm{Dhs}$

[16492|p565] One week he worked 5.5 hours on Saturday and 3 hours on Sunday. How much overtime pay would he earn?
[16493|p565|T1] Answer
[16494|p565] Saturday overtime = 1.5 × $12.50 × 5.5 (time-and-a-half = 1.5 × normal

[16495|p565] Saturday overtime  $= 2 \times \$ 12.50 \times 3\) (double-time  $= 2 \times$  normal time)

[16615|p570] Simple interest involves adding the interest amount to the original amount at regular intervals. The formula used to calculate simple interest is:
[16616|p570] $$
I = \frac {P R T}{1 0 0}, \text {w h e r e :}

[16635|p571] How long will it take for $250 invested at the rate of 8% per annum simple interest to grow to $310?
[16636|p571|T1] Answer
[16637|p571] Amount = principal + interest
[16638|p571] Interest = amount - principal
[16639|p571] ∴Interest = $310 - $250 = $60
[16640|p571] Rate = 8% per annum =  $\frac{8}{100} \times 250 = \$ 20$
[16641|p571] So the interest per year is $20.
[16642|p571] Total interest  $(60)\div$  annual interest  $(20) = 3$
[16643|p571] So it will take three years for  $250 to grow to$ 310 at the rate of 8% per annum simple interest.

[16645|p571] Calculate the rate of simple interest if a principal of  $250 grows to$ 400 in three years.
[16646|p571|T1] Answer
[16647|p571] Interest paid = $400 - $250 = $150
[16648|p571] $$
I = \frac {P R T}{1 0 0}
$$
[16649|p571] Change the subject of the formula to  $R$  to find the rate.
[16650|p571] $$
1 0 0 I = P R T
$$
[16651|p571] $$
R = \frac {1 0 0 I}{P T} = \frac {1 0 0 \times 1 5 0}{2 5 0 \times 3} = 2 0
$$
[16652|p571] So, the interest rate = 20%
[16653|p571|T1] TIP
[16654|p571] You can manipulate the formula to find any of the values:
[16655|p571] $$
I = \frac {P R T}{1 0 0}
$$
[16656|p571] $$
P = \frac {1 0 0 J}{R T}
$$
[16657|p571] $$
R = \frac {1 0 0 I}{P T}

T = \frac {1 0 0 I}{P R}

[16715|p574] Deposit of  $20\% = \frac{20}{100} \times 30000 = \$  6000$
[16716|p574] Outstanding balance = $30000 - $6000 = $24000
[16717|p574] Interest of  $10\% = \frac{10}{100} \times 24000 = \$  2400$
[16718|p574] Amount to be paid by instalments = outstanding balance + interest

[16907|p582] The price the goods are sold at is called the selling price.

[17061|p589] computational (miscalculating a value using the basic operations)
[17062|p589] - precision (mistakes with signs, decimal places, forgetting brackets or order of operations, missing units, incorrect notation)
[17063|p589] - mathematical (not using properties or rules, not completing all the steps needed to solve the problem).

[17261|p601] Sketch the graph of  $y = x^{2} + 2x - 3$ .
[17262|p601|T1] Answer
[17263|p601] $x^{2}$  is positive, so the graph is U shaped.
[17264|p601] y-intercept  $= (0, - 3)$  Remember that there is only ever one y-intercept.
[17265|p601] To find the  $x$ -intercepts make  $y = 0$ , so
[17266|p601] $$
x ^ {2} + 2 x - 3 = 0
$$
[17267|p601] $$
(x + 3) (x - 1) = 0
$$
[17268|p601] $$
x = - 3 \text {o r} x = 1

[17269|p601] So,  $(-3,0)$  and  $(1,0)$  are the  $x$ -intercepts.

$$
[17282|p602] (1, 0) and  $(-3, 0)$  are the  $x$ -intercepts.
[17283|p602] Find the axis of symmetry using  $x = -\frac{b}{2a}$ $x = \frac{4}{2(-2)} = -1$
[17284|p602] Substitute  $x = -1$  into the equation to find the  $y$ -coordinate of the turning point.
[17285|p602] $$
y = - 2 (- 1) ^ {2} - 4 (- 1) + 6 = 8
$$
[17286|p602] The turning point is at  $(-1, 8)$  and is a maximum because a is negative.
[17287|p602] Sketch the graph and label all the important features.

[17295|p602] Consider the equation  $y = x^{2} + 4x - 5$ .
[17296|p602] You can rewrite this in completed square form as  $y = (x + 2)^2 - 9$ .
[17297|p602] Squaring any value gives an answer that is either positive or 0. So, for any value of  $x$ , the smallest possible value of  $(x + 2)^2$  is 0.
[17298|p602] This means that the minimum value of  $(x + 2)^2 - 9$  is -9 and that this occurs when  $x = -2$ .
[17299|p602] The turning point of the graph  $y = (x + 2)^2 - 9$  has the coordinates  $(-2, -9)$ .

[17406|p608] Step 1: Identify the shape of the graph.
[17407|p608] The value of  $a$  determines where the curves will be on the graph.

[17502|p612] There are two such points marked A and B on the graph.
[17503|p612] The  $x$ -coordinates of these points are -1.8 and 3.8, so the solutions of the equation  $x^{2} - 2x - 7 = 0$  are  $x = -1.8$  and  $x = 3.8$ .
[17504|p612] b Find the points on the curve that have a  $y$ -coordinate of 3. (Draw in the horizontal line  $y = 3$  to help with this.)
[17505|p612] There are two such points, marked  $P$  and  $Q$ , on the graph.
[17506|p612] The  $x$ -coordinates of these points are -2.3 and 4.3, so the solutions of the equation  $x^2 - 2x - 7 = 3$  are  $x = -2.3$  and  $x = 4.3$ .
[17507|p612] c Rearrange the equation  $x^{2} - 2x = 1$  so that the left-hand side matches the equation of the graph you are using.
[17508|p612] Subtracting 7 from both sides gives  $x^{2} - 2x - 7 = 1 - 7$ , that is,  $x^{2} - 2x - 7 = -6$ .
[17509|p612] You can now proceed as you did in parts (a) and (b).
[17510|p612] Find the points on the curve that have a  $y$ -coordinate of  $-6$ ; they are marked  $S$  and  $T$  on the graph.
[17511|p612] The  $x$ -coordinates of these points are -0.4 and 2.4.
[17512|p612] The solutions of the equation  $x^{2} - 2x = 1$  are  $x = -0.4$  and  $x = 2.4$
[17513|p612] In summary, to solve a quadratic equation graphically:

[17674|p620] i To solve  $x^{3} - 2x^{2} - 1 = 0$  , find the point(s) on the curve that have a  $y$  -coordinate of 0.
[17675|p620] There is only one point (A on the graph).
[17676|p620] The  $x$ -coordinate of  $A$  is 2.2, so the approximate solution of  $x^3 - 2x^2 - 1 = 0$  is  $x = 2.2$ .
[17677|p620] ii To solve  $x^{3} - 2x^{2} = -1$ , rearrange the equation so that the left-hand side is the same as the equation shown by the graph.
[17678|p620] Subtracting 1 from both sides gives  $x^{3} - 2x^{2} - 1 = -2$ .
[17679|p620] Now find the point(s) on the curve that have a  $y$ -coordinate of  $-2$ .
[17680|p620] There are three points  $(B_{1},B_{2}$  and  $B_{3}$  on the graph).
[17681|p620] The  $x$ -coordinates of these points are the solutions of the equation.
[17682|p620] So the approximate solutions of  $x^{3} - 2x^{2} = -1$  are  $x = -0.6$ ,  $x = 1$  and  $x = 1.6$ .
[17683|p620] iii Rearrange the equation  $x^{3} - 2x^{2} - 5 = 0$  so that you can use the graph of  $y = x^{3} - 2x^{2} - 1$  to solve it.
[17684|p620] Adding 4 to both sides of the equation gives  $x^{3} - 2x^{2} - 1 = 4$ .
[17685|p620] Find the point(s) on the curve that have a  $y$ -coordinate of 4.
[17686|p620] There is only one point (C on the graph).
[17687|p620] At  $C$  the  $x$ -coordinate is 2.7.

[17944|p634] The derivative of function tells you the gradient at the point where the  $x$ -coordinate is  $x$ . To find the gradient at a particular point, substi...
[17945|p634] $$
\frac {d y}{d x} = 1 2 x ^ {2}
$$
[17946|p634] Multiply by the power and subtract 1 from the power.
[17947|p634] $$
\frac {d y}{d x} \text {a t} x = 2 \text {i s} 1 2 \times 2 ^ {2} = 4 8
$$
[17948|p634] Substitute  $x = 2$  to find the gradient at the point where the  $x$ -coordinate is 2.
[17949|p634] The gradient of the curve at the point (2, 32) is 48.

[17968|p634] 3 Find the coordinates of the point at which the curve with equation  $y = 3x^2$  has gradient 18.
[17969|p634|T1] Differentiating sums and differences
[17970|p634] The equation of a curve may involve more than one term and you may be asked to differentiate expressions like  $y = x^2 + x^4$  or  $y = 3x^2 - 4x$ .
[17971|p634] To do this, you differentiate each term independently.
[17972|p634] You can see this by differentiating  $y = 4x^3$  and then rewriting the answer as a sum of separate terms:
[17973|p634] $$
\begin{array}{l} y = 4 x ^ {3} \\ \Rightarrow \frac {\mathrm {d} y}{\mathrm {d} x} = 1 2 x ^ {2} \\ \end{array}
$$
[17974|p634] You can rewrite  $12x^{2}$  as the sum:
[17975|p634] $$
\frac {d y}{d x} = 3 x ^ {2} + 3 x ^ {2} + 3 x ^ {2} + 3 x ^ {2}
$$
[17976|p634] Compare this to the original equation, also written as a sum of separate terms:
[17977|p634] $$
y = x ^ {3} + x ^ {3} + x ^ {3} + x ^ {3}.
$$
[17978|p634|T1] TIP
[17979|p634] Remember that you will need to use the x-coordinate in each case. Look back at Worked example 24 if you need help.
[17980|p635] You can see that each term has been differentiated independently.
[17981|p635] So we have the rule:
[17982|p635] $$
\text {I f} y = a x ^ {m} + b x ^ {n} \text {t h e n} \frac {\mathrm {d} y}{\mathrm {d} x} = a m n ^ {m - 1} + b n x ^ {n - 1}.
$$
[17983|p635] You can extend this rule to adding any number of terms together and it also works for subtraction.

y = 5 x = 5 x ^ {1} \Rightarrow \frac {\mathrm {d} y}{\mathrm {d} x} = 5 x ^ {0} = 5

[18086|p638] $$
\begin{array}{l} \text {I f} x = 2 \text {t h e n :} \\ y = 3 (2) ^ {2} - 4 (2) + 1 \\ = 1 2 - 8 + 1 \\ = 5 \\ \end{array}

[18087|p638] Substitute  $x = 2$  into
[18088|p638] the equation to find the y-coordinate.
[18089|p638] So the tangent passes through the point (2, 5).
[18090|p638] $$

[18091|p638] So the gradient  $= 6(2) - 4 = 8$

\begin{array}{l} y = 2 2 - 4 \times 2 + 1 \\ = 4 - 8 + 1 = - 3 \\ \end{array}

[18121|p639] You can see that the point  $(2, -3)$  is the lowest point of the graph. The value  $-3$  is known as the minimum value of  $y$ .
[18122|p639] If you complete the square to check the answer, you can see that

\begin{array}{l} y = x ^ {2} - 4 x + 1 \\ = (x - 2) ^ {2} - 3 \\ \end{array}

[18141|p641] Substitute  $x = 1.9$  and  $x = 2.1$  to find the gradient on either side of the turning point:
[18142|p641] At  $x = 1.9$ ,  $\frac{\mathrm{dy}}{\mathrm{dx}} = 2 \times 1.9 - 4 = -0.2$ . The curve is sloping downwards.

[18167|p642] Given that the coefficient of  $x^3$  is positive, the left graph must be the correct one. Notice that the maximum point lies on the left, with a lowe...
[18168|p642|T1] Method 2 - using the value of the gradient either side of the turning point
[18169|p642] For (0, 1) find the gradient at -0.1 and 0.1:
[18170|p642] At  $-0.1$ ,  $\frac{dy}{dx} = 6 \times (-0.1)^2 - 6 \times (-0.1) = 0.06 + 0.6 = 0.66$  so the curve slopes upwards.
[18171|p642] At  $0.1, \frac{dy}{dx} = 6 \times (0.1)^2 - 6 \times (0.1) = 0.06 - 0.6 = -0.54$  so the curve slopes downwards.
[18172|p642] So  $(0,1)$  is a maximum point.
[18173|p642] For (1, 0) find the gradient at 0.9 and 1.1:
[18174|p642] At  $0.9, \frac{dy}{dx} = 6 \times (0.9)^2 - 6 \times (0.9) = 4.86 - 5.4 = -0.54$  so the curve slopes downwards.
[18175|p642] At  $1.1, \frac{dy}{dx} = 6 \times (1.1)^2 - 6 \times (1.1) = 7.26 - 6.6 = 0.66$  so the curve slopes upwards.
[18176|p642] So (1, 0) is a minimum point.

[18180|p643] This is negative, so (0, 1) is a maximum point.
[18181|p643] $$
F o r (1, 0), \frac {d ^ {2} y}{d x ^ {2}} = 1 2 \times 1 - 6 = 6
$$
[18182|p643] This is positive, so (1, 0) is a minimum point.

[18512|p657] There are two types of symmetry in three-dimensional shapes:
[18513|p657] plane symmetry
[18514|p657] rotational symmetry.
[18515|p657|T1] Plane symmetry

[18560|p659|T1] 19.3 Symmetry properties of circles
[18561|p659] A circle has line symmetry about any diameter and it has rotational symmetry about its centre. From these facts a number of results can be deduced:
[18562|p659] 1 The perpendicular bisector of a chord passes through the centre.
[18563|p659] 2 Equal chords are equidistant from the centre, and chords equidistant from the centre are equal in length.
[18564|p659] 3 Two tangents drawn to a circle from the same point outside the circle are equal in length.

[18566|p659] The Earth rotates about an axis of symmetry. Where the Earth's axis meets the Earth's surface you will find the Geographical North and South Poles.

[18568|p660] Make sure you remember the correct names of circle parts.
[18569|p660] These were covered in Chapter 3 and revised in the Getting started activities in this chapter.
[18570|p660] The perpendicular bisector of a chord passes through the centre
[18571|p660] The perpendicular bisector of chord  $AB$  is the locus of points equidistant from  $A$  and  $B$ .
[18572|p660] But centre  $O$  is equidistant from  $A$  and  $B$  (OA and OB are radii of circle with centre  $O$ ).
[18573|p660] ...  $O$  must be on the perpendicular bisector of  $AB$ .
[18574|p660] This result can be expressed in other ways:
[18575|p660] The perpendicular from the centre of a circle to a chord meets the chord at its midpoint.
[18576|p660] The line joining the centre of a circle to the midpoint of a chord is perpendicular to the chord.
[18577|p660] You can use this fact to find the lengths of chords and the lengths of sides of right-angled triangles drawn between the centre and the chord.

[18592|p661] If chords  $AB$  and  $CD$  are the same length, then  $OM = ON$ , and vice versa.
[18593|p661] This is true because triangle OAM is congruent to triangle ODN and because the circle has rotational symmetry about its centre,  $O$ .

[18595|p661|T1] TIP

[18599|p661] O is the centre of the circle, radius 11 cm.

[18601|p661] If  $OX = OY$  find the length of OY correct to 2 decimal places.
[18602|p661|T1] Answer
[18603|p661] Since  $OX = OY$  , chords are equidistant so,  $AB = CD = 14cm$
[18604|p661] $CY = YD = 7$  cm (OY is the perpendicular bisector of CD)
[18605|p661] $$
\text {A n g l e} O Y D = 9 0 ^ {\circ}
$$
[18606|p661] $$
\begin{array}{l} O Y ^ {2} = O D ^ {2} - Y D ^ {2} (\text {P y t h a g o r a s}) \\ = 1 1 ^ {2} - 7 ^ {2} \\ = 1 2 1 - 4 9 \\ = 7 2 \\ \end{array}

[18611|p661] The result is  $PA = PB$ .
[18612|p661] In addition:
[18613|p661] the tangents subtend equal angles at the centre (i.e. angle  $POA =$  angle  $POB$

[18667|p665|T1] The angle between the tangent and radius is  $90^{\circ}$
[18668|p665] Look at the diagram carefully.
[18669|p665] A tangent touches a circle at one point only.
[18670|p665] If you draw lines from the centre to points on the tangent, you can see that the shortest possible line is a radius. (OA).
[18671|p665] You already know that the shortest distance from a point to a line is the perpendicular distance from the point to the line.
[18672|p665] So, the radius is perpendicular to the tangent.

[18788|p671|T1] Understanding the alternate segment theorem
[18789|p671] 1 a Follow these instructions.
[18790|p671] Draw three large circles.
[18791|p671] - Draw a tangent to each circle, taking care to be as accurate as possible - your line should only touch the circle once.
[18792|p671] Draw a chord so that it meets the tangent.
[18793|p671] - Draw an angle between the tangent and chord. You can choose either angle.
[18794|p671] Work out which segment is the alternate segment and draw an angle in it.
[18795|p671] Measure, as accurately as you can, both the angle in the alternate segment and the angle between the tangent and the chord.
[18796|p671] b What do you notice?
[18797|p671] The alternate segment theorem states that the angle between the tangent and chord is always equal to the angle in the alternate segment. The diagram s...
[18799|p671] 2 How do you prove the alternate segment theorem?
[18800|p671] This is an interesting proof because it will use some of the theorems that you already know.

[18812|p672] Find the unknown angle  $x$  in the diagram.
[18814|p672|T1] Answer
[18815|p672] Angles in a triangle add to  $180^{\circ}$
[18816|p672] $$
\therefore A B C + B A C + 4 0 ^ {\circ} = 1 8 0 ^ {\circ}
$$
[18817|p672] Both AC and BC are tangents to the circle so triangle ABC is isosceles.
[18818|p672] $$
A B C + B A C + 4 0 ^ {\circ} = 1 8 0 ^ {\circ}
$$
[18819|p672] $$
\therefore A B C = B A C = 7 0 ^ {\circ}
$$
[18820|p672] By the alternate segment theorem, angle  $ABC =$  angle  $ADB = 70^{\circ}$ .
[18821|p672] $$
S _ {0} x = 7 0 ^ {\circ}

[18970|p682] On a histogram with unequal class intervals:
[18971|p682] - The horizontal scale is continuous and each column of the graph is drawn above a particular class interval.
[18972|p682] The frequency of the data is shown by the area of the bars. Frequency density is shown against the vertical axis.
[18973|p682|T1] Working with unequal class intervals
[18974|p682] When the class intervals are not equal you cannot use the height of each bar to work out the frequency. Instead, you need to use the area of each bar.
[18975|p682] When the class intervals are unequal you use the vertical scale to show the frequency density:
[18976|p682] $$

[18987|p682] [Table Row] <tr><td>5 ≤ h ≤ 15</td><td>4</td></tr>

[18991|p683|T1] WORKED EXAMPLE 1 CONTINUED
[18992|p683|T1] Answer
[18993|p683] First work out the frequency density by adding columns to your frequency distribution table like this:
[18994|p683] [Table Row] <tr><td>Height (h) in cm</td><td>Number of plants</td><td>Class width</td><td>Frequency density (frequency + class width)</td></tr>
[18995|p683] [Table Row] <tr><td>5 ≤ h ≤ 15</td><td>4</td><td>10</td><td>4/10 = 0.4</td></tr>
[18996|p683] [Table Row] <tr><td>15 &lt; h ≤ 20</td><td>8</td><td>5</td><td>8/5 = 1.6</td></tr>
[18997|p683] [Table Row] <tr><td>20 &lt; h ≤ 25</td><td>7</td><td>5</td><td>7/5 = 1.4</td></tr>
[18998|p683] [Table Row] <tr><td>25 &lt; h ≤ 40</td><td>6</td><td>15</td><td>6/15 = 0.4</td></tr>
[18999|p683] Next draw the axes. You will need to decide on a suitable scale for both the horizontal and the vertical axes.
[19000|p683] Once you have done this, draw the histogram, paying careful attention to the scales on the axes.
[19002|p683|T1] TIP
[19003|p683] If you plotted the data against frequency instead of frequency density (see histogram), it looks like there are more plants in the 25-40 class compare...
[19005|p683] interval is misleading here, so we use frequency density as it is a better way to compare frequencies in classes of different sizes.
[19006|p683|T1] TIP
[19007|p683] The heights in cm are the class intervals. The number of plants is the frequency.

[19321|p697] To find the position of a percentile use the formula  $\frac{pn}{100}$ , where  $p$  is the percentile you are looking for and  $n$  is how much data ...
[19322|p697] Using the data set in Worked example 6:
[19323|p697] The position of the 10th percentile on the cumulative frequency axis is:
[19324|p697] $$
\mathrm {P} _ {1 0} = \frac {1 0 \times 1 0 0 0}{1 0 0} = 1 0 0
$$
[19325|p697] The position of the 85th percentile on the cumulative frequency axis is:
[19326|p697] $$
\mathrm {P} _ {8 5} = \frac {8 5 \times 1 0 0 0}{1 0 0} = 8 5 0
$$
[19327|p697] Remember that 100 and 850 are only the positions of the 10th and 85th percentile. To find the actual values of the percentiles you need to use the cum...
[19328|p697|T1] TIP
[19329|p697] The position of percentile  $p$  is the value at  $p$  percent  $= \frac{p}{100} \times n$ .

[19333|p698|T1] Answer
[19334|p698] 80% of 200 is 160.
[19335|p698] So, the value of P80 is a test score of 35. (Read off the graph where the curve is 160.)
[19336|p698] Only those candidates who scored above 35 marks on the test will be invited for an interview.

[19374|p700|T1] SUMMARY
[19375|p700] Do you know ...?
[19376|p700] Histograms are specialised bar graphs used for displaying continuous and grouped data.
[19377|p700] If the class widths are unequal, the bars are not equally wide and the vertical axis shows the frequency density.
[19378|p700] frequency per class interval Frequency density  $=$  class width
[19379|p700] Cumulative frequency is a running total of the class frequencies up to each upper class boundary.
[19380|p700] When cumulative frequencies are plotted they give a cumulative frequency curve or ogive.
[19381|p700] The curve can be used to estimate the median value in the data.
[19382|p700] The data can be divided into four equal groups called quartiles. The interquartile range is the difference between the upper and lower quartiles  $(Q_...
[19383|p700] Large amounts of data can be divided into percentiles, which divide the data into 100 equal groups. If a score of 20 out of 25 is at the 82nd percenti...

[19756|p720|T1] 21.1 Working with ratio
[19757|p720] A ratio is a numerical comparison of amounts. The order in which you write the amounts is very important. For example, if there is one teacher for eve...
[19758|p720] We normally write ratios in the form  $1:25$ , but when we work with them, it is sometimes useful to express the ratio as a fraction.
[19759|p720] Think about the teacher to student ratio 1:25. This means there is 1 teacher for every 25 students.
[19760|p720] You can write this as  $\frac{1}{25}$ . This fraction compares the number of teachers with the number of students. It means that there is  $\frac{1}{2...
[19761|p720] So, if there are 150 students you can use the fraction to work out how many teachers there are:
[19762|p720] $$
\begin{array}{l} \frac {1}{2 5} = \frac {?}{1 5 0} \\ \frac {1}{2 5} \text {o f} 1 5 0 = 6 \\ \end{array}
$$
[19763|p720] So, for 150 students there will be 6 teachers.
[19764|p720] 6 is equivalent to  $\frac{1}{25}$  and this matches the ratio 1:25.
[19765|p720] When you write two quantities as a ratio, you must make sure they are both in the same units. For example, the ratio of 20c to $1 is not 20:1, it is 2...

[20019|p729] - calculating the scaled length of an object given its real length.
[20020|p729] In both cases you will be told one of the lengths and the scale, expressed as 'length on the diagram: real length'.

\frac {x}{4 8 0} = \frac {1}{1 2 0 0 0}

[20167|p735] A bus travels  $210\mathrm{km}$  in three hours, what is its average speed in  $\mathrm{km / h}$ ?
[20168|p735] Answer
[20169|p735] $$
\text {S p e e d} = \frac {D}{T}

[20188|p735] Answer
[20189|p735] $$
\text {T i m e} = \frac {D}{S}
$$
[20190|p735] $$
\text {D i s t a n c e} = 2 0 0 \mathrm {k m}, \text {s p e e d} = 8 0 \mathrm {k m} / \mathrm {h}

[20281|p739|T1] Speed in distance-time graphs
[20282|p739] The steepness gradient of a graph gives an indication of speed.
[20283|p739] - A straight line on a graph indicates a constant speed. Any change in the angle of the line indicates a change of speed.
[20285|p740] The steeper the graph, the greater the speed.
[20286|p740] An upward slope and a downward slope represent movement in opposite directions.
[20287|p740] The distance-time graph shown is for a person who walks, cycles and then drives for three equal periods of time. For each period, speed is given by th...
[20288|p740] $$
\text {s p e e d} = \frac {\text {d i s t a n c e} \text {t r a v e l l e d}}{\text {t i m e} \text {t a k e n}}
$$
[20290|p740] Speed is a rate of change. A straight line from the origin shows a constant rate of change and you can use the formula  $\frac{\text{change in } y}{\t...
[20291|p740] If the gradient changes along the graph, the speed will be different for different time periods.
[20292|p740] The gradient precisely describes the steepness of a line.
[20293|p740] In the diagram, the steepness of line  $AB$  is measured by: increase in y-coordinate increase in x-coordinate
[20294|p740] This is the same as  $\frac{\text{rise}}{\text{run}}$  or gradient of a straight line graph.
[20295|p740] A positive gradient means that as  $x$  increases  $y$  also increases.
[20296|p740] On a distance-time graph, the  $y$  value indicates distance from the starting point, so a positive gradient means the object is moving away from the ...
[20297|p740] For a distance-time graph:
[20298|p740] $$
\frac {\text {c h a n g e i n y - c o o r d i n a t e (d i s t a n c e)}}{\text {c h a n g e i n x - c o o r d i n a t e (t i m e)}} = \frac {\text...
[20299|p740] Therefore, the gradient of the graph tells you the speed of the object and its direction of motion. This is known as the velocity of the object.
[20301|p741] Here is another example:
[20302|p741] The travel graph represents a car journey.
[20303|p741] The horizontal sections have zero gradient (so the car was stationary during these times).
[20304|p741] For section  $AB$ , the gradient is positive:
[20305|p741] $$
\text {G r a d i e n t} = \frac {N B}{A N} = \frac {4 0 - 0}{0 . 5} = 8 0 \mathrm {k m / h}
$$
[20306|p741] the velocity was  $80\mathrm{km / h}$  in the direction away from home.
[20307|p741] For section  $CD$ , the gradient is negative:
[20308|p741] $$
\text {G r a d i e n t} = \frac {2 0 - 4 0}{0 . 2 5} = - 8 0 \mathrm {k m / h}
$$
[20309|p741] ..the velocity was  $-80\mathrm{km / h}$
[20310|p741] For section  $EF$  the gradient is negative:
[20311|p741] $$
\text {G r a d i e n t} = \frac {0 - 2 0}{0 . 3 5} = - 5 7. 1 \mathrm {k m} / \mathrm {h}
$$
[20312|p741] the velocity was  $-57.1\mathrm{km / h}$
[20314|p741|T1] MATHEMATICAL CONNECTIONS
[20315|p741] You learned how to calculate the gradient of a straight line graph in Chapter 10. Remember the gradient of a line is:
[20316|p741] positive if the line slopes up from left to right
[20317|p741] negative if the line slopes down from left to right.
[20318|p741|T1] TIP
[20319|p741] When the velocity is positive, the direction of motion is away from home. When the velocity is negative, the direction is towards home.

[20371|p744] The train starts at zero speed.

[20373|p744] The train travels at a constant speed (horizontal section) of  $18\mathrm{m / s}$  for 25 seconds.

[20550|p752|T1] Answer
[20551|p752] 30km/h takes 24 minutes.
[20552|p752] This is inverse proportion; as one value decreases the other increases.
[20553|p752] So,  $1\mathrm{km / h}$  would take  $30\times 24$  minutes.
[20554|p752] To get  $1\mathrm{km / h}$  you divide the speed by 30, so multiply the time by 30.
[20555|p752] at 36km/h it will take 30x24 36
[20556|p752] To get  $36\mathrm{km / h}$  you multiply the speed by 36, so divide the time by 36.

[20935|p768] The product of two consecutive integers is 42. Form and solve a quadratic equation to find both possible pairs of integers.
[20936|p768|T1] Answer
[20937|p768] Use the letter  $n$  to represent the smaller of the two numbers. Then the larger of the two numbers is  $n + 1$ .
[20938|p768] The product of the two numbers is 42, so
[20939|p768] $$
\begin{array}{l} n (n + 1) = 4 2 \\ \Rightarrow n ^ {2} + n = 4 2 \\ \Rightarrow n ^ {2} + n - 4 2 = 0 \\ \Rightarrow (n + 7) (n - 6) = 0 \\ \Right...

[20942|p768] $$
\text {I f} n = 6, \text {t h e n} n + 1 = 7.
$$
[20943|p768] Check: 6 and 7 are consecutive integers and  $6 \times 7 = 42$ .

[20952|p769|T1] Answer
[20954|p769] Always draw a diagram to show the information and to help you visualise the situation.
[20955|p769] The area is the length  $\times$  width, so
[20956|p769] $$
\begin{array}{l} x (x + 2) = 1 5 \\ \Rightarrow x ^ {2} + 2 x = 1 5 \\ \Rightarrow x ^ {2} + 2 x - 1 5 = 0 \\ \Rightarrow (x + 5) (x - 3) = 0 \\ \R...
[20957|p769] $x$  is the width of the rectangle,
[20958|p769] so it cannot be a negative number.
[20959|p769] This means  $x$  must be 3.
[20960|p769] The dimensions of the rectangle are
[20961|p769] $$
3 \mathrm {c m} \times 5 \mathrm {c m}.
$$
[20962|p769] Its perimeter  $= 3 + 5 + 3 + 5 = 16\mathrm{cm}$
[20963|p769] Use  $x$  to represent the width of the rectangle. This means that the length will be  $x + 2$

[20966|p769|T1] Answer
[20967|p769] Use the formula for the area of a triangle:
[20968|p769] $$
\begin{array}{l} \frac {1}{2} b h = 3 \\ \Rightarrow b h = 6 \\ \Rightarrow h = \frac {6}{b} \tag {1} \\ \end{array}
$$
[20969|p769] Now use Pythagoras' theorem and the fact that the hypotenuse has length  $\sqrt{13}$  cm:
[20970|p769] $$
b ^ {2} + h ^ {2} = 1 3 \tag {2}
$$
[20971|p769] Substitute [1] into [2]:
[20972|p769] $$
\begin{array}{l} b ^ {2} + \left(\frac {6}{b}\right) ^ {2} = 1 3 \\ \Rightarrow b ^ {2} + \frac {3 6}{b ^ {2}} = 1 3 \\ \end{array}

[21164|p776|T1] 22.3 Functions and function notation

[21166|p776|T1] Function notation
[21167|p776] Function notation is a mathematical way of writing equations (functions). Function notation is widely used in computer applications and also in techni...
[21168|p776] You already know that a function can be represented in a number of ways. For example, you can show the function  $y = 4x - 1$  using:
[21169|p776] a function machine (flow diagram): Input  $\rightarrow \boxed{\times 4}\rightarrow \boxed{-1}\rightarrow$  output
[21170|p776] a mapping diagram:
[21172|p776] a table of values:
[21173|p776] [Table Row] <tr><td>x</td><td>1</td><td>2</td><td>3</td></tr>
[21174|p776] [Table Row] <tr><td>y</td><td>3</td><td>7</td><td>11</td></tr>
[21175|p776] a set of  $x$  and  $y$  -values (coordinates):  $\{(1,3),(2,7),(3,11),(4,15)\}$  In set notation this is written as  $\{(x,y):y = 4x - 1\}$
[21176|p776] a graph:
[21178|p776] When you write the equation  $y = 4x - 1$  in function notation it becomes  $f(x) = 4x - 1$ .
[21179|p777] You read  $\mathrm{f}(x)$  as 'the function of  $x$ ' or 'f of  $x$ '.
[21181|p777] If  $f(x) = 4x - 1$ , then  $f(5)$  means the value of the function when  $x = 5$ .
[21182|p777] In other words,  $f(5) = 4 \times 5 - 1 = 19$ .
[21183|p777] Similarly.  $f(-2) = 4 \times -2 - 1 = -9$ .
[21184|p777] The number  $4x - 1$  is sometimes called the image of  $x$  (under function  $f$ ).
[21185|p777] When a problem involves two or more functions, you use different letters to represent them. For example, you could have:
[21186|p777] $$
g (x) = x ^ {2} - 2 x + 3 \text {a n d} h (x) = 5 x - 3
$$
[21187|p777] You can show the steps you take to work out the value of any function  $f(x)$  using a simple flow diagram. For example, you can represent the functio...
[21188|p777] $$
x - \boxed {x 5} - \boxed {- 3} \rightarrow 5 x - 3
$$
[21189|p777] The function  $j(x) = 5(x - 3)$  can be represented as:
[21190|p777] $$
x \rightarrow \boxed {- 3} \rightarrow \boxed {\times 5} \rightarrow 5 (x - 3)
$$
[21191|p777] Note that the flow charts show the same operations but, as they are done in a different order, they produce different results.

[21251|p779|T1] Domain and range
[21252|p779] A function is defined by a rule that provides the output values for corresponding input values.
[21253|p779] The domain (D) of a function is the set of input values. These are the possible values for the independent variable (the  $x$ -values).
[21254|p779] The range (R) is the set of output values from the rule. These are the  $y$ -values, which are dependent on the variable input.
[21255|p779] There may be restrictions on the domain. For example, if you are working with time or distance, the input values cannot be negative. Restrictions on t...

[21339|p781] Input  $\rightarrow$  [function 1]  $\rightarrow$  output of function 1  $\rightarrow$  [function 2]  $\rightarrow$  output
[21340|p781] Look at these two functions:  $f(x) = 2x + 1$  and  $g(x) = x^2$ .
[21341|p781] You can apply function f followed by function g to find the composite func. For the input  $x = 4$ :
[21342|p781] $$
f (4) = 2 (4) + 1 = 8 + 1 = 9
$$
[21343|p781] $$
(9 \text {i s t h e r e s u l t o f t h e f i r s t f u n c t i o n .})
$$
[21344|p781] $$
\mathrm {g} (9) = 9 ^ {2} = 8 1
$$
[21345|p781] $$
\text {(T h e f u n c t i o n g h a s b e e n a p p l i e d t o t h e r e s u l t .)}
$$
[21346|p781] You can write what has been done as  $g[f(4)] = 81$ . However, normally the square brackets are left out and you just write  $g f(4) = 81$ .
[21347|p782] $\mathbf{gf}(x)$  is a composite function.
[21348|p782] The order of the letters in a composite function is important:
[21349|p782] $$
\operatorname {g f} (4) \neq \operatorname {f g} (4)
$$
[21350|p782] $\operatorname{fg}(x)$  means do f first then g, but  $\operatorname{fg}(x)$  means do g first then f.
[21351|p782] So, the function closest to the  $x$  is applied first.
[21352|p782] You can also find an algebraic expression for the composite function  $\operatorname{gf}(x)$ :
[21353|p782] $$
\mathrm {f} (x) = 2 x + 1
$$
[21354|p782] $(2x + 1$  is the result of the first function.)
[21355|p782] $$
\mathrm {g} (2 x + 1) = (2 x + 1) ^ {2}
$$
[21356|p782] $$
= 4 x ^ {2} + 4 x + 1

[21425|p783|T1] Inverse functions
[21426|p783] The inverse of any function (f) is the function that will do the opposite of f. In other words, the function that will undo the effects of f. So, if f...
[21427|p783] In effect, when  $f$  is applied to a number and the inverse of  $f$  is applied to the result, you will get back to the number you started with.
[21428|p783] In simple cases, you can find the inverse of a function by inspection. For example, the inverse of  $x \to x + 5$  must be  $x \to x - 5$  because sub...
[21429|p783] Similarly, the inverse of  $x \to 2x$  is  $x \to \frac{x}{2}$ , because to undo multiply by two you have to divide by two.
[21430|p783] The inverse of the function (f) is written as  $\mathsf{f}^{-1}$
[21431|p784] So, if  $f(x) = x + 5$ , then  $f^{-1}(x) = x - 5$ .
[21432|p784] and, if  $g(x) = 2x$ , then  $g^{-1}(x) = \frac{x}{2}$ .
[21433|p784] Some functions do not have an inverse. Think about the function  $x \to x^2$ . This is a function because for every value of  $x$ , there is only one ...

[21435|p784] You briefly worked with inverse functions in trigonometry in Chapter 15.
[21436|p784|T1] Finding the inverse of a function
[21437|p784] There are two methods of finding the inverse:
[21438|p784] Method 1: using a flow diagram.
[21439|p784] In this method you draw a flow diagram for the function and then work out the inverse by 'reversing' the flow to undo the operations in the boxes.
[21440|p784] Method 2: reversing the mapping.
[21441|p784] In this method you use the fact that if  $f$  maps  $x$  onto  $y$ , then  $f^{-1}$  maps  $y$  onto  $x$ .
[21442|p784] To find  $f^{-1}$  you have to find a value of  $x$  that corresponds to a given value of  $y$ .
[21443|p784] Worked examples 17-20 show how to find the inverse for two functions, first using method 1 and then using method 2.

[21446|p784|T1] Answer
[21447|p784] Using method 1, the flow diagram, you get:  $f \colon$  input  $\rightarrow \boxed{\times 3} \rightarrow \boxed{-4} \rightarrow$  output
[21448|p784] Reversing the diagram gives:  $f^{-1}$ : output  $\leftarrow \boxed{+3} \leftarrow \boxed{+4} \leftarrow \text{input}$
[21449|p784] Let  $x$  be the input to  $f^{-1}:\frac{x + 4}{3}\gets \boxed{+3}\gets \boxed{+4}\gets x$

[21454|p784] Using method 1, the flow diagram, you get:  $g \colon \text{input} \to \boxed{\times(-2)} \to \boxed{+5} \to \text{output}$
[21455|p784] Reversing the diagram gives:  $g^{-1}$ : output  $\leftarrow \boxed{+(-2)} \leftarrow \boxed{-5} \leftarrow \text{input}$
[21456|p784] Let  $x$  be the input to  $g^{-1}:\frac{x - 5}{-2}\gets \boxed{+(-2)}\gets \boxed{-5}\gets x$

[21460|p785|T1] Answer
[21461|p785] Using method 2, reversing the mapping.
[21462|p785] $$
y = 3 x - 4
$$
[21463|p785] Suppose the function maps  $x$  onto  $y$  (  $y$  is the subject).
[21464|p785] $$
y + 4 = 3 x
$$
[21465|p785] Make  $x$  the subject of the formula, so that  $y$  maps onto  $x$ .
[21466|p785] $$
x = \frac {y + 4}{3}
$$
[21467|p785] You know that  $f^{-1}$  maps  $y$  onto  $x$ , so  $f^{-1}(y) = \frac{y + 4}{3}$ .
[21468|p785] This is usually written in terms of  $x$  so,  $f^{-1}(x) = \frac{x + 4}{3}$

[21470|p785] Given  $g(x) = 5 - 2x$ , find  $g^{-1}(x)$ .
[21471|p785|T1] Answer
[21472|p785] Let  $y = 5 - 2x$  This means g maps x onto y.
[21473|p785] $2x = 5 - y$  Make  $x$  the subject of the formula, so that  $y$  maps onto  $x$
[21474|p785] $$
x = \frac {5 - y}{2}
$$
[21475|p785] g-1 maps y onto x, so g-1(y) =  $\frac{5 - y}{2}$
[21476|p785] This is usually written in terms of  $x$  so,  $g^{-1}(x) = \frac{5 - x}{2}$

[21748|p795|T1] Rotation
[21749|p795] A rotation is a turn around a fixed point. Rotation occurs when an object is turned around a given point. Rotation can be clockwise or anti-clockwise....
[21750|p795] In this diagram, the object has been rotated  $90^{\circ}$  clockwise about the centre of rotation (a vertex of the object).
[21752|p796|T1] Properties of rotation
[21753|p796] A rotation through  $180^{\circ}$  is a half turn; a rotation through  $90^{\circ}$  is a quarter turn.
[21754|p796] A point and its image are equidistant from the centre of rotation.
[21755|p796] Each point of an object moves along the arc of a circle whose centre is the centre of rotation. All the circles are concentric:
[21757|p796] Only the centre of rotation is invariant.
[21758|p796] The object and the image are congruent after rotation.
[21760|p796] The perpendicular bisector of a line joining a point and its image passes through the centre of rotation.
[21762|p796] A line segment and its image are equal in length.
[21764|p796|T1] MATHEMATICAL CONNECTIONS
[21765|p796] You dealt with rotation when you studied rotational symmetry in Chapter 19.
[21767|p797] To describe a rotation you need to give:
[21768|p797] the centre of rotation
[21769|p797] the amount of turn  $(90^{\circ},180^{\circ}$  or  $270^{\circ}$
[21770|p797] the direction of the turn (clockwise or anti-clockwise).
[21771|p797] You can use thin paper or tracing paper to help you with rotations:
[21772|p797] 1 Trace the shape and label the vertices.
[21773|p797] 2 Place the tracing over the object.
[21774|p797] 3 Use the point of a pair of compasses or pen to hold the paper at the point (centre) of rotation.
[21775|p797] 4 Turn the paper through the given turn.

[22183|p824] You can represent each translation as a column vector:

\overrightarrow {A B} = \binom {3} {1}, \quad \overrightarrow {B C} = \binom {- 2} {2}, \quad \overrightarrow {A C} = \binom {1} {3}

[22185|p824] You know that  $\overrightarrow{AB} + \overrightarrow{BC} = \overrightarrow{AC}$ , so:
[22186|p824] $$
\binom {3} {1} + \binom {- 2} {2} = \binom {1} {3}
$$
[22187|p824] So, to add the vectors, you add the corresponding  $x$ - and  $y$ -coordinates:
[22188|p824] $$
\binom {x _ {1}} {y _ {1}} + \binom {x _ {2}} {y _ {2}} = \binom {x _ {1} + x _ {2}} {y _ {1} + y _ {2}}

[22307|p829|T1] The magnitude of a vector
[22308|p829] The magnitude of a vector is its length. You use the notation  $|AB|$  or  $|a|$  to write the magnitude of a vector  $(AB)$ .
[22309|p829] You can use Pythagoras' theorem to calculate the magnitude of a vector.
[22310|p829] In general, if  $\overrightarrow{AB} = \binom{x}{y}$  then  $\left|\overrightarrow{AB}\right| = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2}$ .

[22312|p829] Find the magnitude of the vector  $\overrightarrow{AB} = \begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ -4 \end{pmatrix}$ .
[22313|p829] Answer
[22315|p829] Draw AB as the hypotenuse of a right-angled triangle.
[22316|p829] $$
A B ^ {2} = 3 ^ {2} + 4 ^ {2}
$$
[22317|p829] (Pythagoras' theorem)
[22318|p829] $$
A B ^ {2} = 9 + 1 6
$$
[22319|p829] $$
A B ^ {2} = 2 5
$$
[22320|p829] $$
A B = 5
$$
[22321|p829] $$
\therefore | \overrightarrow {A B} | = 5 \text {u n i t s}
$$
[22322|p829|T1] TIP
[22323|p829] Remember: success criteria are sometimes called 'what I'm looking for'.
[22324|p829|T1] TIP
[22325|p829] The magnitude of a vector is sometimes called the modulus.

[22330|p830|T1] Position vectors
[22331|p830] A vector that starts from the origin  $(O)$  is called a position vector.
[22332|p830] In this diagram, point  $A$  has the position vector  $\overrightarrow{OA}$  or a.
[22333|p830] If  $\mathbf{a} = \begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ 2 \end{pmatrix}$  then the coordinates of point  $A$  will be (3, 2).
[22334|p830] Because the coordinates of the point  $A$  are the same as the components of the column vector  $\binom{3}{2}$  you can use position
[22335|p830] vectors to find the magnitude of any vector.
[22337|p830|T1] WORKED EXAMPLE 23
[22338|p830] The position vector of  $A$  is  $\binom{3}{2}$  and the
[22339|p830] position vector of  $B$  is  $\binom{-2}{4}$

[22815|p851] The first dice lands on a 6. What is the probability of the second dice also landing on 6?
[22816|p851] These two events are independent. The score on the second dice is not affected by the outcome of the first.
[22817|p851] If two events  $A$  and  $B$  are independent, it is always true that
[22818|p851] $P(B$  given that  $A$  has happened)  $= P(B)$
[22819|p851] so in this case, the probability of getting a 6 with the second dice is  $\frac{1}{6}$ .

P (B \text {g i v e n t h a t} A \text {h a s h a p p e n e d}) = \frac {P (A \text {a n d} B)}{P (A)}
$$
[22825|p851] When you deal with Venn diagrams, this rule can be written in set language as:
[22826|p851] $$
P (B \text {g i v e n t h a t} A \text {h a s h a p p e n e d}) = \frac {P (A \cap B)}{P (A)}
$$

[22856|p853] In a group of 50 students, 36 students work on tablet computers, 20 work on laptops and 12 work on neither of these.
[22857|p853] A student is chosen at random. What is the probability that this student:
[22858|p853] a works on a tablet and a laptop computer?
[22859|p853] b works on at least one type of computer?
[22860|p853] c works on a tablet given that he or she works on a laptop?

[22862|p853|T1] Answers
[22863|p853] Start by identifying the sets and drawing a Venn diagram.
[22864|p853] $T =$  {students who work on tablets}  $n(T) = 36$
[22865|p853] $L =$  {students who work on laptops}  $n(L) = 20$
[22866|p853] $50 - 12 = 38$  so there are 38 students in  $T$  and  $L$  combined.
[22867|p853] $36 + 20 = 56$  , but there are only 38 students in  $T$  and L combined.
[22868|p853] $56 - 38 = 18$  so 18 students work on both  $(T\cap L)$
[22870|p853] a P works on both)  $= P(T\cap L) = \frac{18}{50} = \frac{9}{25}$
[22871|p853] b  $P(\text{works on at least one}) = 1 - P(\text{works on neither}) = 1 - \frac{12}{50} = \frac{38}{50} = \frac{19}{25}$
[22872|p853] c  $P(T$  given that  $L$  has happened)  $= \frac{P(L\text{and}T)}{P(L)} = \frac{n(L\cap T)}{n(L)}$

## Common Errors to Check and Fix
1. **Missing headings**: Check that ALL numbered sub-sections are included. Check for missing "Front Matter" or "Back Matter".
2. **False positives**: Instructional labels like "Key points", "Exercises", "Questions" are NOT structural headings — remove them.
3. **Missing parent**: If sections like "22.1", "22.2" exist but "Chapter 22" (or "Unit X") is missing, find and add it.
4. **Fragmented titles**: Merge adjacent title fragments (e.g., "Chapter" + "1") into one entry.
5. **Level errors**: Ensure correct hierarchy: Unit (L1) -> Chapter (L2) -> Section (L3). If no Units, then Chapter (L1).
6. **Table of contents entries**: Only remove entries that are explicitly part of a "Contents" list (with page numbers at the end). DO NOT remove "Introduction" or "Unit" pages.

## Instructions
- Review the previous result against the full document text below
- Fix any of the above errors
- Output the CORRECTED directory in the same JSON format
- Keep entries in LOGICAL document order (not necessarily ascending ID)

## Output Format
Return ONLY valid JSON:

  "directory": [
    {"id": <number or [n1, n2]>, "level": <1|2|3>, "title": "<heading text>"},

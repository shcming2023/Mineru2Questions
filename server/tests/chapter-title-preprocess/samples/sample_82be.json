Atmosphere can best be created by appealing to all five senses: sight, sound, smell, touch, taste. Colour is essential for conveying mood, and size and shape are also important elements in descriptive writing. When more than one adjective is used before a noun, size and shape adjectives go first, colour next, and other types of adjective closest to the noun (e.g. the large, silver framed, speckled, antique mirror; the tiny, square, black, velvet-covered box).",

Each thigh was a ton of meat, ivory and steel mesh. And from the great breathing cage of the upper body those two delicate arms dangled out in front, arms with hands which might pick up and examine men like toys, while the snake neck coiled.

The support he provided, however, was as much emotional as practical.",

So before you begin writing a narrative, think carefully about how you want it to end. One or two events and two or three characters are sufficient for a short story, and the time period which can be effectively covered is usually only a day or two. It is not possible to fit more into the time and space available, and trying to fit too much into a narrative spoils the pace, climax and creation of suspense, and reduces the amount of necessary descriptive detail to convey character and setting.",

        "text": "The Peruvians claim the magnificent site of Machu Picchu as the eighth wonder of the world. But Machu Picchu is overrun by tourists. It is in danger of becoming a modern theme park. The manicured lawns provide a battery recharge for exhausted backpackers who have just completed the Inca Trail. Gardeners work continually on restoring walls and cultivating the terraces. Present-day Peru displays all the problems of a growing country. The modern myth is that history, perhaps, holds the key to their solution.",

I was fascinated by the idea that South America was once joined with Africa, Australia and Antarctica in a huge land mass, which scientists have named Gondwanaland. Many years after the continents separated and drifted apart, it is thought that humans crossed the Bering Strait land bridge from Asia, and moved down through North America and into Central and South America. My recent obsession was with the civilization of the Incas, who settled in the Peruvian mountains and made amazing scientific and technological achievements. Now I planned to 'follow the Inca trail' to see the sites for myself. Of all the wonders these people had achieved,",

Most Europeans have lost the traditional knowledge of how to cope with large carnivores and of how humans and predators can coexist. Local people can actually benefit from working with carnivores. By promoting eco-tourism, a country's tourist industry can be extended. Understandably, there is concern about livestock casualties, but throughout history shepherds have effectively used traditional guarding methods with dogs, and sheep and cattle have been protected by being put in pens at night. Public awareness is needed to counteract the view of wolves as wicked, cunning and merciless. This negative image is fuelled by popular mythology and children's stories, and is based on fear rather than fact. Wolves are actually social, timid animals that avoid contact with humans. Wolf attacks on people are extremely rare, but shedding their bloodthirsty reputation involves public education on many levels. These include educational visits, publicity in the international media and the distribution of literature.",

Dialogue also becomes ineffective if used so much that your writing becomes a playscript, with no intervening narrative. If used appropriately and sparingly, however, speech can help to convey characters' personalities and relationships, especially if the characters speak in a different style from one another. In the story in Activity 1 the characters speak in the same style but their opinions, as expressed through dialogue, are what differentiate them.",

When asked what they were for, he said that he planned to mix them together and set fire to them to make some spectacular smells, colours and noises. Diwan warned him that if he didn't know what he was doing chemicals could be very dangerous, especially when mixed together, and that it wasn't worth the risk of injury or of being caught for stealing. The aggressive response he got was that he was no fun, and much too timid and boring, and that if he wasn't going to join in then Sanjeet would find someone else to hang out with, that day and for ever.",

Empathy is a stronger engagement with a character: the reader feels that they can share the attitudes and feelings of the character and are on their side in that situation. This is created by positioning the reader to admire the character's decisions and behaviour by presenting them positively and by allowing the reader to see the action from their point of view.

The discussion should move on from its starting point and extend more widely – though still relevantly – to avoid repetition of the same ideas.

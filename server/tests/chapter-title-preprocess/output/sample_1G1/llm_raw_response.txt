  "excluded_count": 132,
  "notes": "The document is organized primarily by TOPIC-level titles as level 1 divisions. Lesson-level titles (e.g., Lesson 1-9) are excluded as they appear as repeated pedagogical labels or are too granular without clear hierarchy. Glossary and other repeated appendix headers are excluded. Some 'Set E' entries are kept as level 1 due to their prominence and lack of clear parent. Section dot-numbered entries are excluded as they appear to be sub-subsections or page number artifacts. Unique functional sections like 'TOPIC X Assessment Practice' and 'TOPIC X Performance Task' are included as level 1 due to their unique identifiers and importance."
